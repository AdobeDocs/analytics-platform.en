# Integrate Decision Management with Adobe Customer Journey Analytics


Adobe Journey Optimizer [Decision Management](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioning/get-started-decision/starting-offer-decisioning.html?lang=en) makes personalization easy with a central library of marketing offers and a decision engine that applies rules and constraints to rich, real-time profiles created by Adobe Experience Platform to help you send your customers the right offer at the right time.

Decision Management is part of and integrated with Adobe Journey Optimizer. It can also be used independently of journeys and campaigns defined in Adobe Journey Optimizer, using its rich [API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioning/api-reference/getting-started.html?lang=en) support.

You can import data generated by Decision Management to perform advanced analysis in Customer Journey Analytics by performing the following steps:

## Send data from Decision Management to Adobe Experience Platform

Adobe Experience Platform serves as the central data source and link between Decision Management and Customer Journey Analytics. Data from Decision Management is collected in Experience Platform **automatically** or as part of **explicitly sent experience events** (for example impressions or clicks). See [Getting started with data collection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioning/collect-event-data/data-collection.html?lang=en) for more details.

## Create a connection

Once Decision Management data is in Adobe Experience Platform, you can create a [Connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-connections/create-connection.html?lang=en) based on your Decision Management datasets. Or you can add Decision Management datasets to an existing connection.

Select and configure the following datasets:

| Dataset | Dataset type | Connection settings | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ODE DecisonEvents - _sandbox_ decisioning | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains autogenerated data for Decision Management decision events. _Sandbox_ refers to the specific sandbox name. |
| Adobe Journey Optimizer Message Feedback Event Dataset | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains message delivery events. |
| Adobe Journey Optimizer Email Tracking Experience Event Dataset | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains email tracking events. |
| Adobe Journey Optimizer Push Tracking Experience Event Dataset | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains push tracking events. |
| Adobe Journey Optimizer Entity Dataset | Lookup | Key: `_id`<br>Matching Key: `_experience.decisioning.propositions.`<br>`scopeDetails.correlationID` | Contains classifications that associate Journey and Campaign metadata to all Adobe Journey Optimizer event data. |

## Create a data view

After a connection is created, you can create one or more [Data Views](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/create-dataview.html?lang=en) to configure the desired dimensions and metrics available in Customer Journey Analytics.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Data discrepancies between Adobe Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics are typically less than 1-2%. Larger discrepancies are possible for data collected within the last two hours. Use date ranges excluding today to mitigate discrepancies involving processing time.

### Configure dimensions

You can create the following dimensions in a data view to achieve approximate parity with similar dimensions in Decision Management. See [Component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/overview.md) in the Data View Manager for details around dimension customization options.

| Dimension | Schema element | Component settings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activity Name | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.activity.name` | Component type: Dimension |
| Container Identifier | `_experience.decisioning.containerID` | Component type: Dimension |
| Correlation Identifier | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositions.scopeDetails.correlationID` | Component type: Dimension |
| Decision Option Name | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.selections.name` | Component type: Dimension |
| Fallback Decision Option Name | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.fallback.name` | Component type: Dimension |
| Placement Name | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.placement.name` | Component type: Dimension |

### Configure metrics

You can create the following metrics in a data view to achieve approximate parity with similar metrics in Decision Management. See [Component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/overview.md) in the Data View Manager for details around metrics customization options.

| Metric | Description | Schema element | Component settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event Type (rename to refer to a specific event, for example `Feedback` for `message.feedback`) [1] | Amount of a specific type of event | `eventType` | Component type: Metric<br/>**[!UICONTROL Set Include Exclude Values]**: On<br/>**[!UICONTROL Match]**: [!UICONTROL If all criteria are met]<br/>**[!UICONTROL Criteria]**: **[!UICONTROL Equals]** `message.feedback` | 
| Decision Option Score | Calculated value for a decision option in the context of a single scope. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.selections.score` | Component type: Metric |
| Fallback Decision Option Score | Calculated value for a fallback decision option in the context of a single scope. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.fallback.score` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Dismiss | The number of offers dismissed or rejected without any other direct interaction. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.display` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Display | The number of offers displayed to the profile. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.display` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Interact | The number of offers displayed to the profile. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.interact` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Send | The number of offers sent to the profile. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.send` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Trigger | The number of offers chosen to be displayed by the client SDK. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.trigger` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Unsubscribe | The number of offers requested by profile not to be shown in the future. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.trigger` | Component type: Metric |
