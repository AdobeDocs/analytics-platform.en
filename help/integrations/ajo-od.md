# Integrate Decision Management with Customer Journey Analytics


Adobe Journey Optimizer [Decision Management](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioning/get-started-decision/starting-offer-decisioning.html?lang=en) (AJO-DM) makes personalization easy with a central library of marketing offers and a decision engine that applies rules and constraints to rich, real-time profiles created by Adobe Experience Platform to help you send your customers the right offer at the right time.

AJO-DM is part of and integrated with Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO). It can also be used independently of journeys and campaigns defined in AJO, using its rich [API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioning/api-reference/getting-started.html?lang=en) support.

You can import data generated by AJO-DM to perform advanced analysis in Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) by performing the following steps:

## Send data from Decision Management to Adobe Experience Platform

Adobe Experience Platform serves as the central data source and link between AJO-DM and Customer Journey Analytics. Data from AJO-DM is collected in AEP **automatically** or as part of **explicitly sent experience events** (e.g. for impressions or clicks). See [Getting started with data collection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioning/collect-event-data/data-collection.html?lang=en) for more details.

## Create a connection

Once AJO-DM data is in Adobe Experience Platform, you can can create a [Connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-connections/create-connection.html?lang=en) based on your AJO-DM datasets. Select and configure the following datasets:

| Dataset | Dataset type | Connection settings | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ODE DecisonEvents - _sandbox_ decisioning | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains autogenerated data for Decision Management decision events. _Sandbox_ refers to the specific sandbox name.
| AJO Message Feedback Event Dataset | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains message delivery events. |
| AJO Email Tracking Experience Event Dataset | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains email tracking events. |
| AJO Push Tracking Experience Event Dataset | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains push tracking events. |
| AJO Entity Dataset | Lookup | Key: `_id`<br>Matching Key: `_experience.decisioning.propositions.`<br>`scopeDetails.correlationID` | Contains classifications that associate Journey and Campaign metadata to all AJO event data. |

## Create a data view

After a connection is created, you can create one or more [Data Views](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/create-dataview.html?lang=en) to configure the desired dimensions and metrics available in CJA.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Data discrepancies between AJO and CJA are typically less than 1-2%. Larger discrepancies are possible for data collected within the last two hours. Use date ranges excluding today to mitigate discrepancies involving processing time.

### Configure dimensions

You can create the following dimensions in a data view to achieve approximate parity with similar dimensions in AJO-DM. See [Component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/overview.md) in the Data View Manager for details around dimension customization options.

| Dimension | Schema element | Component settings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activity Name | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.activity.name` | Component type: Dimension |
| Container Identifier | `_experience.decisioning.containerID` | Component type: Dimension |
| Correlation Identifier | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositions.scopeDetails.correlationID` | Component type: Dimension |
| Decision Option Name | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.selections.name` | Component type: Dimension |
| Fallback Decision Option Name | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.fallback.name` | Component type: Dimension |
| Placement Name | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.placement.name` | Component type: Dimension |

### Configure metrics

You can create the following metrics in a data view to achieve approximate parity with similar metrics in AJO-DM. See [Component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/overview.md) in the Data View Manager for details around metrics customization options.

| Metric | Description | Schema element | Component settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event Type (rename to refer to a specific event, e.g. `Feedback` for `message.feedback`) [1] | Number of specifc type of event | `eventType` | Component type: Metric<br/>**[!UICONTROL Set Include Exclude Values]**: On<br/>**[!UICONTROL Match]**: [!UICONTROL If all criteria are met]<br/>**[!UICONTROL Criteria]**: **[!UICONTROL Equals]** `message.feedback` | 
| Decision Option Score | Calcuated value for a decsion option in the context of a single scope. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.selections.score` | Component type: Metric |
| Fallback Decision Option Score | Calcuated value for a fallback decision option in the context of a single scope. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionDetails.fallback.score` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Dismiss | The number of offers dismissed or rejected without any other direct interaction. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.display` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Display | The number of offers displayed to the profile. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.display` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Interact | The number of offers displayed to the profile. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.interact` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Send | The number of offers sent to the profile. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.send` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Trigger | The number of offers chosen to be displayed by the client SDK. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.trigger` | Component type: Metric |
| Offers Unsubscribe | The number of offers requested by profile not to be shown in the future. | `_experience.decisioning.`<br/>`propositionEventType.trigger` | Component type: Metric |

[1] You can define multiple metrics for the various event types available. See [Include Exclude values component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/include-exclude-values.md) for more information.
