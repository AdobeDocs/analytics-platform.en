# Integrate Adobe Journey Optimizer with Adobe Customer Journey Analytics

[Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/get-started/get-started.html) helps you deliver connected, contextual, and personalized experiences. It helps expose your customers to the next step in their customer journey.

You can import data generated by Journey Optimizer to perform advanced analysis in Customer Journey Analytics by performing the following steps:

## Send data from Journey Optimizer to Adobe Experience Platform

Adobe Experience Platform serves as the central data source and link between Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics. See [Get started with Datasets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/data-management/datasets/get-started-datasets.html) in the Journey Optimizer user guide for steps on how to send Journey Optimizer data to Platform as a Dataset.

## Create a connection in Customer Journey Analytics

Once Journey Optimizer data is in Adobe Experience Platform, you can [Create a connection](/help/connections/create-connection.md) based on your Journey Optimizer datasets. Or you can add Journey Optimizer datasets to an existing connection. 

Select and configure the following datasets:

| Dataset | Dataset type | Connection settings | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AJO Message Feedback Event Dataset | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains message delivery events, such as '[!UICONTROL Sends]' and '[!UICONTROL Bounces]'. |
| AJO Email Tracking Experience Event Dataset | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains email tracking events such as '[!UICONTROL Opens]', '[!UICONTROL Clicks]', and '[!UICONTROL Unsubscribes]'. |
| AJO Push Tracking Experience Event Dataset | Event | Person ID: `IdentityMap` | Contains push tracking events such as '[!UICONTROL App Launches]'. |
| Journey Step Events | Event | Person ID: `_experience.journeyOrchestration.`<br>`stepEvents.profileID` | Contains events showing which profiles participated in each node of the journey. |
| AJO Entity Dataset | Lookup | Key: `_id`<br>Matching Key: `_experience.decisioning.propositions.`<br>`scopeDetails.correlationID` | Contains classifications that associate Journey and Campaign metadata to all Adobe Journey Optimizer event data. |

## Configure the Data view to accommodate Journey Optimizer dimensions and metrics

After a connection is created, you can create one or more [Data Views](/help/data-views/create-dataview.md) to configure the desired dimensions and metrics available in Customer Journey Analytics.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Data discrepancies between Adobe Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics are typically less than 1-2%. Larger discrepancies are possible for data collected within the last two hours. Use date ranges excluding today to mitigate discrepancies involving processing time.


### Configure dimensions in the data view

You can create the following dimensions in a data view to achieve approximate parity with similar dimensions in Journey Optimizer. See [Component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/overview.md) in the Data View Manager for details around dimension customization options.

| Dimension | Schema element | Component settings |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Journey Name | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.journey.journeyName` | Component type: Dimension |
| Journey Name & Version | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.journey.journeyNameAndVersion` | Component type: Dimension |
| Journey Node Name | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.journey.journeyName` | Component type: Dimension |
| Journey Node Type | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.journey.journeyNodeType` | Component type: Dimension |
| Campaign name | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.campaign.name` | Component type: Dimension |
| Channel | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.channelDetails.channel._id` | Component type: Dimension |
| Push Title | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.channelDetails.push.title` | Component type: Dimension |
| Email Subject | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.channelDetails.email.subject` | Component type: Dimension |
| Link Label | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageInteraction.label` | Component type: Dimension |
| Experiment Name | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.experiment.experimentName` | Component type: Dimension<br>Context Labels: Experimentation Experiment |
| Treatment Name | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`entities.experiment.treatmentName` | Component type: Dimension<br>Context Labels: Experimentation Variant |
| Email Delivery Failure Reason | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageDeliveryfeedback.messageFailure.reason` | Component type: Dimension |
| Email Delivery Exclusion Reason | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageDeliveryfeedback.messageExclusion.reason` | Component type: Dimension |
| Element Label | `_experience.decisioning.propositionAction.label` | Component type: Dimension |

### Configure metrics in the data view

You can create the following metrics in a data view to achieve approximate parity with similar metrics in Journey Optimizer. See [Component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/overview.md) in the Data View Manager for details around metrics customization options.

| Metric | Description | Schema element | Component settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bounces | The number of messages that bounced, including both immediate bounces and bounces after delivery. | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageDeliveryfeedback.feedbackStatus` | Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: If any criteria are met<br>Equals: `bounce`, Equals: `denylist` |
| Bounces After Delivery | Some email services report emails delivered, then bounce them later. | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageDeliveryfeedback.messageFailure.category` | Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `async` |
| Email Clicks | The count of clicks within messages. | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageInteraction.interactionType` | Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `click` |
| Email Opens | The number of opened messages. | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageInteraction.interactionType` | Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `open` |
| Errors | The number of messages that errored out. | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageDeliveryfeedback.feedbackStatus` | Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `error` |
| Excludes | The number of messages excluded. | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageDeliveryfeedback.feedbackStatus` | Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `exclude` |
| Sends | The number of messages that email providers accepted. | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageDeliveryfeedback.feedbackStatus` | Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `sent` |
| Spam Complaints | The count of spam complaints. | `_experience.customerJourneyManagement.`<br>`messageInteraction.interactionType` | Component type: Metric<br>Include exclude values: Equals `spam_complaint` |

| Inbound Displays | The number of times a Web or InApp message is shown to the user | Use the schema string element `_experience.decisioning.propositionEventType.display` |
| Inbound Clicks | The count of Web or InApp message clicks | Use the schema string element `_experience.decisioning.propositionEventType.interact` |
| InApp Triggers | The number of times the decisioning engine suggested the message should be displayed. The Mobile SDK could override the decision reducing the number of actual displays. | Use the schema string element `_experience.decisioning.propositionEventType.trigger` |
| InApp Dismissals | The number of times an InApp message is removed from the UI by the SDK | Use the schema string element `_experience.decisioning.propositionEventType.dismiss` |

### Configure calculated metrics in Analysis Workspace

Once you have configured the desired dimensions and metrics for the Journey Optimizer dataset, you can also configure [Calculated metrics](/help/components/calc-metrics/calc-metr-overview.md) for additional insights around that data. These calculated metrics are based on the above metrics created in the Data View Manager.

| Calculated metric | Description | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Messages Sent | The total number of messages sent. Includes successful or failed messages. | `[Sends] + [Bounces] - [Bounces After Delivery]` |
| Messages Delivered | The number of emails delivered to customers. | `[Sends] - [Bounces After Delivery]` |
