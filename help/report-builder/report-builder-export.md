# Export data from Report Builder

You can export Customer Journey Analytics reports from Report Builder. You might want to export Customer Journey Analytics reports for a number of reasons, such as to utilize them in third-party tools or combine them with outside data.

The following sections describe supported export locations, the various methods available for exporting, and the advantages of each method.

## Supported export locations
