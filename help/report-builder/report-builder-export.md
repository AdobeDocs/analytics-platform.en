# Export data from Report Builder

You can export Customer Journey Analytics reports from Report Builder. You might want to export Customer Journey Analytics reports for a number of reasons, such as to utilize them in third-party tools or combine them with outside data.

The following sections describe supported export locations, the various methods available for exporting, and the advantages of each method.

## Supported export locations

In the legacy Report Builder, you could schedule a workbook to be delivered by email or by FTP. Because of security concerns, we no longer support FTP in the new Report Builder.

These export locations are supported:

* Amazon S3 Role ARN
* Google Cloud Platform
* Azure SAS
* Azure RBAC
