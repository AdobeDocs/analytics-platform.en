## Calendar

The **[!UICONTROL Calendar]** option allows you to create static or rolling dates using the following options:

    - Select a value for current. For example **[!UICONTROL current year]**.
    - Select a value for additional calculation. For example, **[!UICONTROL plus]**.
    - When you have specified additional calculation, specify a value. For example `1`.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL hide]** to hide the details for rolling dates calculation.


### Custom expressions

The custom expression option allows you to change the date range by building a custom expression or you can enter an arithmetic formula.

![Date range custom expression](assets/date-range-custom-expression.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Use custom expression]**.

    When you select  **[!UICONTROL Use custom expression]** , the standard rolling date range controls are disabled.

## Date range from cell

The date range can be specified in worksheet cells. Use the **[!UICONTROL Date range from cell]** option to choose the data block start and end date from selected cells. When you select the **[!UICONTROL From cell]** option, the panel displays **[!UICONTROL From]** and **[!UICONTROL To]** fields where you can enter a cell location.

![Select From cell Sheet1!H4 to Sheet1!I4](./assets/date-range-from-cell.png)


## Exclude today

Select **[!UICONTROL Exclude today]**  to exclude today from a selected date range. The current day is excluded from all modes used to define a date range: calendar, rolling dates, or custom expressions.


## Valid date ranges

The following list describe valid date range formats.

- The start and end dates must be in the following format: YYYY-MM-DD

- The start date must be earlier to or equal to the end date. Both dates can be set to the future.

- When using rolling dates, the start date must be today or in the past. The start day must be in the past if **[!UICONTROL Exclude today]** is selected.

- You can create a static date range set for the future. For example, you may need to set a future date for a marketing campaign launch next week. This option creates a workbook monitoring for a campaign ahead of time.

## Change the date range

You can edit the date range of an existing data block. 

1. Select a cell in your data block. 

- Select **[!UICONTROL Edit data block]** in the **[!UICONTROL Commands]** panel, or 
- Select the **[!UICONTROL Date range]** link in the **[!UICONTROL Quick edit]** panel. 
  
1. Modify the date range using any of the date selection options available.
