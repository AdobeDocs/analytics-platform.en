## Quick edit panel

When you select one or more data blocks in a spreadsheet, Report Builder displays the **[!UICONTROL Quick edit]** panel. You can use the **[!UICONTROL Quick edit]** panel to change parameters in a single data block or in multiple data blocks at the same time.

The changes you make when you use the **[!UICONTROL Quick Edit]** sections apply to all selected data blocks.

### Data views

Data blocks pull data from a selected data view. If multiple data blocks are selected in a worksheet and they don't pull data from the same data view, the **Data views** link displays **[!UICONTROL _Multiple_]**.

When you change the data view, all data blocks in the selection adopt the new data view. Components in the data block are matched to the new data view based on ID. If a component isn't found in a data block the component is removed and replaced with **[!UICONTROL Invalid value]** or an ![AlertRed](/help/assets/icons/AlertRed.svg) is displayed for the specific component.

To change the data view, select a new data view from the **[!UICONTROL Data view]** drop-down menu.


### Date range

**Date range** shows the date range for the selected data blocks. If multiple data blocks are selected with multiple date ranges, the **[!UICONTROL Date range]** link displays **[!UICONTROL _Multiple_]**.

### Segments

The **Segments** link displays a summary list of the segments used by the selected data blocks. If multiple data blocks are selected with multiple segments applied, the **Segments** link displays **[!UICONTROL _Multiple_]**.
