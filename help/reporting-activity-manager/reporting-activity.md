# View reporting activity {#view-reporting-activity}

The [!UICONTROL Reporting Activity Manager] enables administrators to quickly diagnose and fix reporting capacity issues during peak reporting times.

For more information about Reporting Activity manager, including key benefits and permission requirements, see [Reporting Activity Manager overview](/help/reporting-activity-manager/reporting-activity-overview.md).

## For all connections {#view-all-report-suites}

>abstract="This table shows the connections for which you have rights to manage reporting activity. Information about each connection is available in each column of the table."

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD034 -->


1. In Customer Journey Analytics, go to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Reporting Activity Manager]**.

   A list of your enabled base connections is displayed. 

   ![Reporting Activity showing the reports queue](assets/reporting-activity1.png)

1. To view the total number of report requests for all connections in your organization, expand [!UICONTROL **Show more**] to view the [!UICONTROL **Monthly report requests**] graph.

   You can view the number of report requests within your organization for the current month and the previous month.  

   ![Reporting Activity showing the reports queue](assets/reporting-activity-monthly.png)

1. (Optional) You can search or filter the list of connections:

   * Use the search field to search for a specific connection. Begin typing the connection name or ID and the list of connections updates as you type.

   * Select ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) to expand the list of filter options. You can filter by [!UICONTROL **Favorites**] or [!UICONTROL **Status**].

     To mark a connection as a favorite, select the star icon to the left of the connection name.
      
     <!-- (does this option still exist?) 1. (Optional) Select **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** at the top-right to refresh the data. -->

1. View utilization information about each connection. The data shown in the table represents the reporting activity for the connection at the time the page was last loaded.

   The following columns are available: 

   | UI Element | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | **[!UICONTROL Connection]** | The connection whose reporting activity you are monitoring.|
   |  **[!UICONTROL Data Views]** | Shows all data views that use the connection. Data view configuration can add complexity to reporting requests. |
   | **[!UICONTROL Capacity utilization]** | The percentage of the connection's reporting capacity that is being used, in real time. <p>**Note** A usage capacity that is at 100% doesn't necessarily suggest that you should immediately start cancelling reporting requests. 100% usage capacity can be healthy if the average wait time is reasonable. On the other hand, 100% usage capacity could suggest a problem if the number of queued requests is also growing.</p> |
   | **[!UICONTROL Queued requests]** | The number of requests waiting to be processed. <!-- ??? --> |
   | **[!UICONTROL Queue wait time]** | The average wait time before requests begin to process. <!-- ???? --> |
   | **[!UICONTROL Status]** | The possible statuses are: <ul><li>[!UICONTROL **Active**] (blue): Reports have been run on the connection in the last 2 hours. The data shown in the table represents the reporting capacity for the connection at the time the page was last loaded.</li><li>[!UICONTROL **Inactive**] (gray): No reports have ever been run on the connection in the last 2 hours, so no data is displayed for the connection.</li></ul> |

## For a single connection

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Tools**] > [!UICONTROL **Reporting Activity Manager**].

1. Select the linked title of the connection for which you want to view details.

   Reporting activity data is displayed for the connection that you selected.

1. (Optional) When a connection first loads in the Reporting Activity Manager, the data displayed represent the current utilization metrics. To see updated metrics after the initial load, select the [!UICONTROL **Refresh**] button to manually refresh the page.

   * [View table](#view-table)

### View graphs

The following graphs are available to help you better understand the activity happening in the connection. 

If graphs are not visible, select the [!UICONTROL **Show graphs**] button.

#### Utilization graph {#utilization}

The Utilization graph shows reporting utilization for the selected connection over the last 2 hours. 

Hover over the chart to view points in time where the usage capacity percentage was highest for that minute.

* **X-axis**: The reporting usage capacity over the last 2 hours.
* **Y-axis**: The reporting usage capacity percentage, by minute.
