# Report on Marketo Engage data

You can leverage available Marketo Engage datasets in Experience Platform to provide valuable analytics and reporting solutions to B2B marketers. Then report on these datasets in Customer Journey Analytics.

Be aware that:

* Marketo Engage reporting is best for measuring and optimizing marketing programs directly in Marketo, and is fast, prescriptive, and marketer-friendly. 
* Customer Journey Analytic provides a much broader, customizable analytics solution for customer journeys that span multiple channels, products, and business units, including, but not limited to, Marketo data.

See [reporting comparison](#reporting-comparison) for more details.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You might consider the [Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition](/help/getting-started/cja-b2b-edition.md) to get much more value from Marketo Engage data. You can combine Marketo Engage datasets with account and lookup datasets. And report on account and opportunity level in Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition.

To report on Marketo Engage data in Customer Journey Analytics:

+++ 1. Map Marketo source data fields to their XDM targets

Map the [Persons](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo) and [Activities](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/mapping/marketo) objects to their respective XDM schema target fields.

+++

+++ 2. Ingest Marketo data into Adobe Experience Platform

Use the [Marketo Engage connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo) to bring data from Marketo to Experience Platform and keep this data up to date using Platform-connected applications.

+++

+++ 3. Set up a connection to this dataset in Customer Journey Analytics

To report on Experience Platform datasets, you first have to establish a connection between datasets in Experience Platform and Customer Journey Analytics. See [Create or edit a connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-connections/create-connection).

+++


+++ 4. Create one or more data views

A [data view](/help/data-views/data-views.md) is a container specific to Customer Journey Analytics that lets you determine how to interpret data from a connection. It specifies all dimensions and metrics available in Analysis Workspace - in this case, metrics and dimensions specific to Marketo. It also specifies which columns those dimensions and metrics obtain their data from. Data views are defined in preparation for reporting in Analysis Workspace. 

+++ 

+++ 5. Report in Analysis Workspace

One use case you might explore is: How many web page visits by leads did you have in April-June 2020?

1. Open [Analytics Workspace](/help/analysis-workspace/home.md) and create a new project. 
   Customers with B2B/B2P CDP can conduct B2C-style analysis in Customer Journey Analytics. B2B objects are not yet available.

1. Create a [segment](/help/components/segments/seg-create.md) for web page views as follows - Event Type = web.webpagedetails.pageViews : 

   ![Definition window showing Event and Event Type](../assets/marketo-filter.png)

1. Pull in the segment that you created into the Freeform table - Web Page Views, then pull in the Month date range. This action gives you Web page visits by leads each month:

   ![Freeform table showing Events by Month.](../assets/marketo-freeform.png)

1. Or pull in the following dimensions: Person Key or Work Email Address. This action gives you the Web page visits by each lead:

Marketo Engage data in Customer Journey Analytics can differ from what you see in the reports found in Marketo Engage.
