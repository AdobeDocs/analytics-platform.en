# Build product value

You want to deliver B2B product value insights to product managers and CMO or CEOs. For example, through a data driven churn analysis or predications. And make these insights digestible through mobile dashboards.

Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition can support you to deliver product value insights. See the following sections for examples.


## Reduce churn

You want to identify accounts with low product usage, low brand engagement, and other key factors that indicate a high churn potential. This early identification allows you to develop account activation strategies.

The [Active growth](/help/guided-analysis/types/active-growth.md) guided analysis can help you to determine to:

* Derive insights about the growth and acquisition of accounts, opportunities, and users over a specific period.
* Spot dormant accounts, with no recent engagement. So you can determine a strategy for renewal or upsell.
* Partner with your customer success or sales organization to re-enage dormant accounts. You can investigate low usage, and plan product enhancements to address churn and overcome slow or stalled adoption.

### Example

You want to see the net active growth across you new, repeat, return, and dormant accounts.

1. Create an [Active growth](/help/guided-analysis/types/active-growth.md) guided analysis.
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Accounts]** as **[!UICONTROL Counted as]**.
1. Select the preferred **[!UICONTROL Chart settings]**. For example: ![GraphBarVerticalStacked](/help/assets/icons/GraphBarVerticalStacked.svg) **[!UICONTROL Stacked bar]**.
1. Select the preferred ![Calendar](/help/assets/icons/Calendar.svg) **[!UICONTROL Interval]** and **[!UICONTROL Date range]**.
