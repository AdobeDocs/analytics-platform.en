# Grow key accounts

Growing and retaining key accounts is a high priority for B2B companies. A prerequisite to ensure that deals progress is to communicate with key stakeholders in your target accounts at the right time.

When you consider how to grow key accounts through new acquisition or retention or upsell motions, Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition assists you (the sales team and business analysts) with deeper insights in sales stage progression and cross team collaboration. See the following sections for examples.

## Sales stage progression

You want to generate and distribute ad-hoc lead conversion reports and understand how accounts progress through the sales funnel.

The [Fallout](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/fallout/fallout-flow.md) visualization lets you visualize conversion and drop-off rates between pre-defined steps in a sequential journey.

### Example

You want to see the fallout of the top of the sales funnel (from lead to opportunity) for accounts.

1. [Create and configure a Fallout](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/fallout/configuring-fallout.md) visualization.
1. Select ![Setting](/help/assets/icons/Setting.svg) to select **[!UICONTROL Account]** as the **[!UICONTROL Fallout container]**.
1. The first touchpoint should read **[!UICONTROL All Accounts]**.
1. Add a new touchpoint: **[!UICONTROL Lead Form: Complete exists]**.
1. Add a new touchpoint: **[!UICONTROL Lead Generated exists]**.
1. Add a new touchpoint: **[!UICONTROL MQL Qualified exists]**.
