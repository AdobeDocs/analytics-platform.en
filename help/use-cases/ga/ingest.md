# Ingest Google Analytics data into Adobe Experience Platform

This page focuses on how to ingest your Google Analytics historical data into Adobe Experience Platform as a dataset, allowing you to reference that dataset in a Data View within Customer Journey Analytics. You can combine the steps on this page with [Configuring a live Google Analytics implementation](overview.md#configure), which generates a recurring dataset. Combine this historical dataset with your current implementation's dataset to get a seamless view of data in Customer Journey Analytics with both current and backfilled data.

## Prerequisites

In order to accomplish these tasks, you need the following access and permissions:

* Access to Adobe Experience Platform
* Access to Google Analytics (GA Standard or GA 360)
* [Admin Access](/help/getting-started/cja-access-control.md) to Customer Journey Analytics

## Set up a BigQuery Export

The data structure in Universal Analytics properties is different from the data structure in Google Analytics 4 properties. Set up a BigQuery Export based on the property type that you want to export data from:

* [Set up a BigQuery Export for a Universal Analytics property](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3416092)
* [Set up a BigQuery Export for a Google Analytics 4 property](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9823238)

### Additional requirements for Universal Analytics properties

>[!NOTE]
>
>This section only applies to Universal Analytics properties. If you are exporting from a GA4 property, you can proceed to [Export data to Google Cloud Platform](#export-gcp).

Universal Analytics properties store each record in their data as a user's session instead of individual events. A SQL query to transform the Universal Analytics data into a format compatible with Adobe Experience Platform is required. Apply the `UNNEST` function to the `hits` field in the GA schema, and save it as a BigQuery table.

```sql
SELECT
   *,
   timestamp_seconds(`visitStartTime` + hit.time) AS `timestamp` 
FROM
   (
      SELECT
         fullVisitorId,
         visitNumber,
         visitId,
         visitStartTime,
         trafficSource,
         socialEngagementType,
         channelGrouping,
         device,
         geoNetwork,
         hit 
      FROM
         `example_bq_table_*`,
         UNNEST(hits) AS hit 
   )
```

## Export data to Google Cloud Platform {#export-gcp}

In Google Cloud Platform, navigate to **Export > Export to GCS**. Once the data is in Google Cloud Storage, it is ready to be pulled into Adobe Experience Platform.

## Import the data from Google Cloud Storage into Experience Platform

1. In Adobe Experience Platform, select **[!UICONTROL Sources]** on the left.
1. Under the Catalog, locate **[!UICONTROL Google Cloud Storage]** option. Click **[!UICONTROL Add data]**.

>[!TIP]
>
>If you plan to import both historical and live streaming Google Analytics data, make sure that you use the same schema for both datasets. You can merge the datasets in a CJA using a [Combined dataset](/help/connections/combined-dataset.md).

You can map the GA event data into an existing dataset that you created previously, or create a new dataset, using whichever XDM schema you choose. Once you have selected the schema, the Experience Platform applies machine learning to automatically pre-map each of the fields in the Google Analytics data to your [XDM schema](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html#ui).

![Schema map](assets/schema-map.png)

Mappings are easy to change and you can create derived or calculated fields from your data. Once you have finished mapping the fields into your XDM schema, you can schedule this import on a recurring basis as well as apply error validation during the ingestion process. This validation ensures that there aren’t any issues with the data you have imported.

## Required XDM fields

Certain XDM fields in Platform require the correct format in order for data to be correctly processed.

* **`timestamp`**: Create a special calculated field in the Experience Platform schema UI. Click **[!UICONTROL Add calculated field]** and wrap the `timestamp` string in a `date` function:

   `date(timestamp, "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssZ")`

   Save the calculated field to the timestamp data structure in the schema:

   ![Timestamp](assets/timestamp.png)

* **`_id`**: This field must have a value in it - CJA does not care what the value is. You can add a "1" to the field:

   ![ID](assets/_id.png)

## Next steps

* Create a [data view](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/create-dataview.html#cja-dataviews) based on the connection that contains Google Analytics data.

* Do some amazing [analysis in Workspace](/help/use-cases/ga-to-cja-reporting.md).

Datasets in Adobe Experience Platform consist of a schema and the data itself. You can either create a custom schema yourself, or map the desired export fields to XDM fields. Adobe plans to alleviate this tedious step in the future by creating a Field Group with all Google Analytics data columns included.
