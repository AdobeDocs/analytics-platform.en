## Third-party use cases in Customer Journey Analytics

Many organizations collect data using multiple products. These additional data points can enrich data collected through the Web SDK or Mobile SDK and provide valuable insights.

Adobe offers several ways to get this data into Customer Journey Analytics, including:

* Implementation modifications to collect data from other libraries on your site
* Tag extensions offered through Adobe Exchange
* Source Connectors

The ideal method that you opt to use to bring in third-party data depends on several factors, including data availability, effort to make implementation changes, and available integrations.
