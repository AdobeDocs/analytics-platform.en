# Add Quantum Metric friction events to Customer Journey Analytics

Quantum Metric collects friction events such as page load slowness, page load errors, rage clicks, and more. These events can be passed into Customer Journey Analytics as complementary events in the user journey. With this combined data, you can better understand the impact of friction on downstream metrics.

This use case has two requirements:

* You must be entitled to Quantum Metric's **Dev Ops** package.
* You must use tags in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection.

## Step 1: Capture friction events using the Quantum Metric tag extension

Draw the rest of the owl, apparently
