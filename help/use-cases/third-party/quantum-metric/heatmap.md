# Use Quantum Metric heatmaps with Customer Journey Analytics

Linking Quantum Metric heatmapping to CJA data lets you better understand page-level engagement and optimize pages based on consumer behavior. Workspace can be used to understand consumer user flows and see what paths consumers follow from one page to the next. Then, you can click hyperlinked Page URLs to visually heatmap how users engage with the content.

This use case has two requirements:

* You must be entitled to Quantum Metric's **UX Ops** package.
* You must use tags in Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection.
