# Use Quantum Metric heatmaps with Customer Journey Analytics

Linking Quantum Metric heatmapping to CJA data lets you better understand page-level engagement and optimize pages based on consumer behavior. Workspace can be used to understand consumer user flows and see what paths consumers follow from one page to the next. Then, you can click hyperlinked Page URLs to visually heatmap how users engage with the content.

## Prerequisites

This use case requires that you collect Quantum Metric's session ID alongside the rest of your implementation. See [Collect Quantum Metric session IDs in Customer Journey Analytics](collect-session-id.md) to learn how to modify your implementation.

You must be entitled to Quantum Metric's **UX Ops** package in order to access Quantum Metric's heatmap capabilities.

## Viewing heatmaps by clicking links within Customer Journey Analytics

Once you create the Workspace report with clickable links, you can use Filters in Customer Journey Analytics to identify interesting sessions that you can further analyze in Quantum Metric.
