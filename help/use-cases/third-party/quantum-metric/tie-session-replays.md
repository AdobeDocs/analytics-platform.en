# Tie Quantum Metric session replays to data in Customer Journey Analytics

By linking Quantum Metric session replays with CJA data, customers can better understand "the why" behind "the what".  Workspace can be used to discover sessions with friction, then you can click hyperlinked session IDs to explore the session replay in Quantum Metric.  This data allows for viewing behavior within a session and better understanding of what drives consumer friction.

## Prerequisites

This use case requires that you collect Quantum Metric's session ID alongside the rest of your implementation. See [Collect Quantum Metric session IDs in Customer Journey Analytics](collect-session-id.md) to learn how to modify your implementation.

## Viewing sessions from Customer Journey Analytics

Once you create the Workspace report with clickable links, you can use Filters in Customer Journey Analytics to identify interesting sessions that you can further analyze in Quantum Metric.
