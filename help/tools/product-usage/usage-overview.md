# Product usage overview

{{release-limited-testing}}

Product usage provides your organization with the ability to view analytics data on how your organization uses Customer Journey Analytics. It is available for all organizations that use Customer Journey Analytics. Once enabled, the following Adobe Experience Platform components are automatically created and hooked up for you. These components are all system-owned, read-only, and cannot be edited.

* A schema in Adobe Experience Platform
* A dataset in Adobe Experience Platform
* A connection in Customer Journey Analytics
* A data view in Customer Journey Analytics

All data collection and setup is automatically configured for you once enabled. Any time a user makes an action in Analysis Workspace, that action is tracked and available for reporting.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This feature counts toward your contractual row limits in Adobe Experience Platform. Make sure that your organization can accommodate the data generated by this feature before enabling it.

## Available dimensions

When you enable Product usage, the following dimensions are available. If you want to change any dimension settings, create a copy of the system-owned data view and use the copied data view in Analysis Workspace.

| Dimension | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Action Name | The type of action that the user took. You can use this dimension as any desired metric by creating a copy in data view settings. |
| Attribution Model Used | The type of attribution model that the component uses. |
| Component | A derived field that includes the component type and component name. |
| Component Type | The type of component added, removed, or modified. |
| Login User | The user that took the action. |
| Panel Used | The panel where the component was added, removed, or modified. |
| Project Name | The friendly name of the project. |
| Project Type | The project type. |
| User ID | The user ID that triggered the event. |
| Visualization Used | The visualization that was added, removed, or modified. |

Product usage does not track individual project components when a project is merely opened or viewed. The user action of opening a project is tracked, however.
