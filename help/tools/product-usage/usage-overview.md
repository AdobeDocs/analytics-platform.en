# Product usage overview

Product usage provides your organization with the ability to view analytics data on how your organization uses Customer Journey Analytics. It is available for all organizations that use Customer Journey Analytics. Once enabled, the following Adobe Experience Platform components are automatically created and hooked up for you. These components are all system-owned, read-only, and cannot be edited.

* A schema in Adobe Experience Platform
* A dataset in Adobe Experience Platform
* A connection in Customer Journey Analytics
* A data view in Customer Journey Analytics

All data collection and setup is automatically configured for you once enabled. Any time a user makes an action in Analysis Workspace, that action is tracked and available for reporting.

>This feature counts toward your contractual row limits in Adobe Experience Platform. Make sure that your organization can accommodate the data generated by this feature before enabling it.

## Enable Product usage

Navigating to this section of the interface in Customer Journey Analytics takes you to [Data settings](data-settings.md) where you can enable this feature.
