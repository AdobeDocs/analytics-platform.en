# Customer Journey Analytics BI extension

{{select-package}}

The [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics BI extension] enables SQL access to the [data views](./data-views.md) that you have defined in Customer Journey Analytics. Your data engineers and analysts might be more familiar with Power BI, Tableau, or other business intelligence and visualization tools (further referred to as BI tools). They can now create reporting and dashboards based on the same data views that Customer Journey Analytics users are using when creating their Analysis Workspace projects.

Adobe Experience Platform [Query Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/home) is the SQL interface to data available in the data lake of Experience Platform. With the [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics BI extension] enabled, the functionality of [!DNL Query Service] is extended to see your Customer Journey Analytics data views as tables or views in a [!DNL Query Service] session. As a result, business intelligence tools that use [!DNL Query Service] as their PostgresSQL interface benefit seamlessly from this extended functionality.

The main benefits are:

* No need to recreate an equivalent representation of Customer Journey Analytics data views within the BI tool itself. <br/>See [Data views](data-views.md) for more information on the functionality of data views to understand what must be recreated.
* Greater consistency in reporting and analysis between BI tools and Customer Journey Analytics.
* Combine Customer Journey Analytics data with other data sources already available in BI tools.

## Prerequisites

To use this functionality, you can use expiring or non-expiring credentials to connect BI tools to the [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics BI extension]. The [Credentials guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/ui/credentials) provides more information on setting expiring credentials or non-expiring credentials.
Below are additional steps to set up CJA Permissions
<!---   Enable the [!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics BI extension] in your Experience Platform organization. -->

### Expiring credentials

To use expiring credentials, you can:

* Grant access to Experience Platform and Customer Journey Analytics. 
* Grant Product admin access to Customer Journey Analytics, so you can view, edit, update, or delete connections and data views.

Or you can: 

* Grant access to the data views you want to access.
* Grant access to the Customer Journey Analytics BI extension.

### Non-Expiring credentials

To use non-expiring credentials: 

* Create non-expiring credentials in Experience Platform.
* Grant access to the non-expiring credentials by following the steps mentioned in [Expiring Credentials](#Expiring-credentials).

See [Customer Journey Access Control](../technotes/access-control.md) for more information, specifically the [Product Admin additional permissions](../technotes/access-control.md#product-admin-additional-permissions) and [Customer Journey Analytics Permissions in the Admin Console](../technotes/access-control.md#customer-journey-analytics-permissions-in-admin-console).

   See [Connect Tableau to Query Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/clients/tableau) for more information.

+++

See [Connect clients to Query Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/clients/overview) for an overview of and more information on the various tools available.

## Functionality

By default, your data views have a table-safe name generated from their friendly name. For example, the data view named [!UICONTROL My Web Data View] has the view name `my_web_data_view`. You can define a preferred name to use in your BI tool for your data view. See [Data view settings](create-dataview.md#settings) for more information.

If you want to use the data view IDs as the table names, you can add the optional `CJA_USE_IDS` setting to your database name when connecting. For example, `prod:cja?CJA_USE_IDS` shows your data views with names like `dv_ABC123`.

### Data governance

The data governance-related settings in Customer Journey Analytics are inherited from Adobe Experience Platform. The integration between Customer Journey Analytics and Adobe Experience Platform Data Governance allows for labeling of sensitive Customer Journey Analytics data and enforcement of privacy policies.

Privacy labels and policies that were created on datasets consumed by Experience Platform can be surfaced in the Customer Journey Analytics data views workflow. Therefore, data queried using the [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics BI extension] show appropriate warnings or errors when not complying with the privacy labels and policies defined.

### List data views

In the standard PostgreSQL CLI, you can list your views using `\dv`

```sql
prod:all=> \dv
                       List of relations
 Schema |                    Name                    | Type |  Owner             
--------+--------------------------------------------+------+----------
 public | my_web_data_view                           | view | postgres
 public | my_mobile_data_view                        | view | postgres

```

### Nested versus flattened

By default, the schema of your data views uses nested structures, just like the original XDM schemas. The integration also supports the `FLATTEN` option. You can use this option to force the schema for the data views (and any other table in the session) to be flattened. Flattening allows for easier use in BI tools that don't support structured schemas. See [Working with nested data structures in Query Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/key-concepts/flatten-nested-data) for more information.


### Defaults and limitations

The following additional defaults and limitations apply when using the BI Extenion:

* The BI extension requires a row limit for the query results. The default is 50, but you can override this in SQL using `LIMIT n`, where `n` is 1 - 50000.
* The BI extension requires a date range to limit the rows used for calculations. The default is the last 30 days, but you can override this in your SQL `WHERE` clause using the special [`timestamp`](#timestamp) or [`daterange`](#date-range) columns.
* The BI extension requires aggregate queries. You can't use SQL like `SELECT * FROM ...` to get the raw, underlying rows. At a high level, your aggregate queries should use:
  * Select totals using `SUM` and/or `COUNT`.<br/> For example, `SELECT SUM(metric1), COUNT(*) FROM ...`
  * Select metrics broken down by a dimension. <br/>For example, `SELECT dimension1, SUM(metric1), COUNT(*) FROM ... GROUP BY dimension1`
  * Select distinct metric values.<br/>For example, `SELECT DISTINCT dimension1 FROM ...`
  
    See for more details [Supported SQL](#supported-sql).


### Supported SQL

See [Query Service SQL reference](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/sql/overview) for the full reference on what type of SQL is supported.

See the table below for examples of the SQL you can use.

### Dimensions

You can select any of the dimensions available by default or defined in the data view. You select a dimension by its ID.

### Metrics

The metrics available to select are:

* Any of the metrics available by default;
* Defined in the data view;
* Calculated metrics that are compatible with the data view that the user has access to.  
 
You select a metric by its ID wrapped in a `SUM(metric)` expression just like you would do with other SQL sources.

You can use:

* `SELECT COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(1)` to get the occurrences metric. 
* `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dimension)` or `SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(dimension)` to count the approximate distinct values of a dimension. See details in [Counting distinct values](#counting-distinct-values).
* [Inline calculations](#inline-calculations) to combine metrics on the fly and/or doing math on them.

#### Counting distinct values

Due to the underlying nature of how Customer Journey Analytics works, the only dimension you can get an exact distinct count for is the `adobe_personid` dimension. The following SQL statements `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT adobe_personid)` or `SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(adobe_personid)` return the value of the default persons metric, which is the count of distinct people. For other dimensions, an approximate distinct count is returned.

#### Conditional metrics

You can embed an `IF` or `CASE` clause in the `SUM` or `COUNT` functions to add additional filtering that is specific to a selected metric. Adding these clauses is similar to applying a filter to a metric column in a Workspace report table.

Examples:

```sql
SUM(IF(dim1 = 'X' AND dim2 = 'A', metric1, 0)) AS m1
```

```sql
SUM(CASE WHEN dim1 = 'X' AND dim2 = 'A' THEN metric1 END) AS m1
```

#### Inline calculations

You can apply additional math to metric expressions in your `SELECT`. This math can be used instead of defining the math in a calculated metric. The following table lists what types of expressions are supported.

| Operator or Function | Details |
|---|---|
|`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` | Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulous/remainder |
| `-X` or `+X` | Changing the sign or a metric where X is the metric expression |
| `PI()` | π constant |
|`POSITIVE`, `NEGATIVE`, `ABS`, `FLOOR`, `CEIL`, `CEILING`, `EXP`, `LN`, `LOG10`, `LOG1P`, `SQRT`, `CBRT`, `DEGREES`, `RADIANS`, `SIN`, `COS`, `TAN`, `ACOS`, `ASIN`, `ATAN`, `COSH`, `SINH`, and `TANH` | Unary math functions |
| `MOD`, `POW`, `POWER`, `ROUND`, `LOG` | Binary math functions |

{style="table-layout:auto"}

### Special columns

#### Timestamp

The `timestamp` special column is used to provide the date ranges for the query. A date range can be defined with a `BETWEEN` expression or a pair of `timestamp` `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` checks `AND`ed together.
The `timestamp` is optional and if no full range is provided, defaults are used:

* If only a minimum is provided (`timestamp > X` or ` timestamp >= X`), the range is from X to now. 
* If only a max is provided (`timestamp < X` or `timestamp <= X`), the range is from X minus 30 days to X. 
* If nothing is provided, the range is from now minus 30 days to now.

The timestamp range is converted to a date range global filter in the RankedRequest.
The timestamp field can also be used in date/time functions to parse or truncate the event timestamp.

#### Date range

The `daterange` special column works similar to `timestamp`; however the filtering is limited to full days. The `daterange` is also optional and has the same range defaults as `timestamp`.
The `daterange` field can also be used in date/time functions to parse or truncate the event date.

The `daterangeName` special column can be used to filter your query using a named date range like `Last Quarter`.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Power BI is not supporting `daterange` metrics that are less than a day (hour, 30 minute, 5 minute, etc.).
>

#### Filter ID

The `filterId` special column is optional and is used to apply an externally defined filter to the query. Applying an externally defined filter to a query is similar to dragging a filter on a panel in Workspace. Multiple filter IDs can be used by `AND`-ing them.

Along with `filterId`, you can use `filterName` to use a filter's name instead of ID.

### Where clause

The `WHERE` clause is handled in three steps:

1. Find the date range from the `timestamp`, `daterange`, or `daterangeName` special fields.
  
1. Find any externally defined `filterId`s or `filterName`s to include in the filtering.

1. Turn the remaining expressions into ad-hoc filters.

The handling is done by parsing the first level of `AND`s in the `WHERE` clause. Each top-level `AND`-ed expression must match one of the above. Anything deeper than the first level of `AND`s, or, if the `WHERE` clause uses `OR`s at the top level, is handled as an ad-hoc filter.

### Sorting order

By default, the query sorts the results by the first selected metric in descending order. You can overwrite the default sorting order by specifying `ORDER BY ... ASC` or `ORDER BY ... DESC`. If you use `ORDER BY`, you must specify `ORDER BY` on the first selected metric.  

You can also flip the order by using `-` (minus) in front of the metric. Both statements below result in the same ordering:

```sql
ORDER BY metric1 ASC
```

```sql
ORDER BY -metric1 DESC
```

### General function support

### Partial Support

Some SQL functionality is only partially supported with the BI extension and does not return the same results you see with other databases.  This specific functionality is used in SQL generated by various BI tools, for which the BI extension does not have an exact match. As a result, the BI extension focuses on a limited implementation that covers the minimum BI tool usage without throwing errors. See the table below for more details.

| Function | Example | Details |
|---|---|---|
| MIN() & MAX() |``MIN(daterange)`` or <br/> ``MAX(daterange)`` | `MIN()` on `timestamp`, `daterange`, or any of the `daterangeX` like `daterangeday` will return 2 years ago.<br/><br/> `MAX()` on `timestamp`, `daterange`, or any of the `daterangeX` like `daterangeday` will return the current date/time.<br/><br/>`MIN()` or `MAX()` on any other dimmension, metric, or expression will return 0. |
