# Standard component reference

Most dimensions and metrics in Customer Journey Analytics are based on schema elements from your Adobe Experience Platform dataset. However, several components are available to add to a data view regardless of the connection that you use.

[!UICONTROL Standard components] are components that are not generated from dataset schema fields but are instead system generated. Some system components are required to facilitate reporting capabilities in Analysis Workspace, while other system components are optional.
