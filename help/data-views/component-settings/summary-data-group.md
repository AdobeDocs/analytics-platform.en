# [!UICONTROL Summary data group] component settings

A summary data group creates an association between all dimensions in the grouping and is used to combine dimensions from summary datasets with other dimensions for reporting.

![Summary data group component settings](/help/data-views/assets/summary-data-group.png)

To create a grouping of dimensions:

1. Select a dimension.
1. Select ![ChevronDown](/help/assets/icons/ChevronDown.svg) **[!UICONTROL Summary data group]**.
1. Enable **[!UICONTROL Create grouping]**.
1. Select a dimension from the **[!UICONTROL Dimension]** dropdown list, that you want to group with the selected dimension from the first step. Note that only dimensions you have already added to the data view are available from the dropdown list.
1. Optionally, enable **[!UICONTROL Hide in reporting]** to hide the grouped dimension from reporting. Enabling this option is similar as configuring **[!UICONTROL Hide in reporting]** on the grouped dimension separately. See [Component settings](overview.md) for more information.
1. Optionally, to add additional dimensions to the grouping, select ![Add](/help/assets/icons/Add.svg) **[!UICONTROL Add dimension to group]**.<br/>You can add up to nine dimensions, as a summary data group has a limit of ten dimensions.

## Same component settings

When grouping dimensions, you must ensure the settings for [!UICONTROL Substring], [!UICONTROL Behavior (Lower case)], and [!UICONTROL Include exclude values], for each of the dimensions that are part of the group, are the same. Otherwise, each dimension of the group can potentially return different results prior to the grouping.
For example:

1. You have created a summary data group for `campaign_code` (part of summary data) and `tracking_code` (part of your event data).
1. You have applied [!UICONTROL Behavior (Lower case)] to the `campaign_code` but not to the `tracking_code` dimension.
   
Values in `tracking_code` can potentially show up as different from `campaign_code`.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Ensure you do the grouping of dimensions from one dimension only, and not apply grouping from multiple dimensions. For example, if you create a grouping by adding the `campaign_name` dimension to the `tracking_code` dimension, do not also create a grouping for the `campaign_name` dimension.
