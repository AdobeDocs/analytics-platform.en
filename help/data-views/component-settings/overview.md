The following information describes the settings that a data view component uses.

![Component settings described in this section](../assets/component-settings.png)

| Setting | Description/Use case |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Component type] | Required. Allow you to change a component from Metric to Dimension or the opposite way. Changing this drop-down selection shifts the component to its respective included components area. |
| [!UICONTROL Component name] | Required. Lets you specify the friendly name that appears in Analysis Workspace. You can rename a component to give it a name specific to the data view. |
| [!UICONTROL Description] | Optional, but recommended. Provides information on the component to other users. |
| [!UICONTROL Tags] | Optional. Let you tag the component with custom or out-of-the-box tags for easier searching/filtering in the Analysis Workspace UI. |
| [!UICONTROL Context labels] | Optional. A drop-down menu of available system-defined [context labels](#context-labels) that can be applied to a component.  |
| [!UICONTROL Schema field name] | The name of the schema field. |
| [!UICONTROL Dataset type] | Required. A non-editable field showing which dataset type (event, lookup, or profile) the component came from. |
| [!UICONTROL Dataset] | A non-editable field showing which dataset that the component originated from. This field can contain multiple datasets. |
| [!UICONTROL Schema type] | A non-editable field showing the data type of the component. While you can use any supported schema field type in Platform, not all fields types are supported in Customer Journey Analytics. The following data types are supported: `Integer`, `Int`, `Long`, `Double`, `Float`, `Number`, `Short`, `Byte`, `String`, and `Boolean`. Only the `String` schema data type is allowed in Lookup datasets currently. |
| [!UICONTROL Component ID] | Required. The [Customer Journey Analytics API](https://adobe.io/cja-apis/docs) uses this field to reference the component. Each component in a data view must be unique. Adobe automatically generates an ID for each component; however, you can click the edit icon and modify the component ID. Changing the component ID breaks all existing Workspace projects that contain this component. While each component needs a unique ID in a single data view, you can use the same component ID in other data views. If you use the same component ID in other data views, you can make Workspace projects compatible across data views. <br/>For profile and lookup based components, the component ID has an ID prefix based on the dataset ID (for example: `642b28fcc1f0ee1c074265a0.person.name.firstName`). When you want to reuse a profile or lookup based component, like `person.name.firstName`, in your Workspace project, and configure this component in different data views, ensure you rename the component ID uniquely (for example: `myUniqueID.person.name.firstName`) across your data views. |
| [!UICONTROL Path] | Required. A non-editable field showing the schema path that the component came from. |
| [!UICONTROL Data Usage Labels] | Any data usage labels that are assigned to this component in Adobe Experience Platform. [Learn more](/help/data-views/data-governance.md). |
| [!UICONTROL Hide component in reporting] | Let you curate the component out of the data view for non-admins. Admins can still access it by clicking [!UICONTROL Show All Components] in an Analysis Workspace project. |

## Context labels

Context labels are system-defined tags applied to components within a data view. When context labels are applied to components (dimension or metrics), Customer Journey Analytics is instructed to use these context-labeled components automatically in certain visualizations or features.

You can only assign a context label to one component in the same data view. You can assign the same context label to different components across data views.

The benefits of context labels are:

* **Convenience**: You don't have to re-select the same component in every panel or visualization.
* **Unlocks functionality**: Some visalization (like [Map](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/map.md)) require knowing which component is latitude and longitude. Assigning context labels discloses that information to the visualization.
* **Consistency**: Everyone in your organization that works on one or more projects that are based on a data view that uses context labels get the same behavior.
* **Visibility of features and templates**: Certain visualizations and features only appear when the proper context label is assigned. For example:
  
  * A [Map](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/map.md) visualization does display properly only when Customer Journey Analytics knows which fields represent latitude and longitude. 
  * Specific [templates](/help/analysis-workspace/templates/use-templates.md) are visible only when the correct context labels are applied and the associated components become available. 

Context labels may be required in the following situations:

* To define a set of components, you can use in experimentation reporting using the [Experimentation panel](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/experimentation.md) in Analysis Workspace projects.
  
  For more information, see [Integrate with Journey Optimizer](/help/integrations/ajo.md#data-view) and [Target reporting](/help/integrations/at.md).

* To define a set of components, you can use within the [Map](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/map.md) visualization in Analysis Workspace projects.

  For more information, see [Add context labels in data views](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/map.md#add-context-labels-in-data-views) in [Map](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/map.md).

  **Note**: The Map visualization is in the Limited Testing phase of release and might not be available yet in your environment.

* When using [templates provided by Adobe](/help/analysis-workspace/templates/use-templates.md). By default, some templates provided by Adobe do not work because they contain components that are not in your data view.
  
  For each missing component, a matching context label is available in your data view. You need to either add the matching context label to a component that is already in your data view. Or you need to add a new component to your data view and add the context label to it.
  
  For more information, see [Add missing components to the data view for a given template](/help/analysis-workspace/templates/create-templates.md#add-missing-components-to-the-data-view-for-a-given-template) in the article [Create and manage templates](/help/analysis-workspace/templates/create-templates.md).
