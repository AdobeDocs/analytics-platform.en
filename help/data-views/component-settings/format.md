## Currency

When you select **[!UICONTROL Currency]** as the [!UICONTROL Format] for a metric, you can determine how to display and convert currencies.

### Display currency

To display a currency for a metric:

1. Enter the number of **[!UICONTROL Decimal places]**.
  
1. Select a currency from the **[!UICONTROL Display currency in]** list.


### Convert and display currency

{{release-limited-testing-section}}

To enable the conversion of a currency for one or more metrics:
   
- Set up your Customer Journey Analytics connection to contain at least one event dataset that holds a currency code dimension for every event containing a currency metric. That currency code dimension uses an alphabetic currency code conforming to the [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) standard for representing currencies. These values should be in full uppercase format such as USD for $, EUR for &euro;, GBP for Â£. 
 
    1. Select the dimension from one of your datasets that holds the currency codes. For example, [!UICONTROL Currency code].

    1. Select **[!UICONTROL Currency Code]** from the list of dimensions.

- Repeat these steps in case that you have more dimensions holding currency codes you want to use for currency conversion.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The metric you select for currency conversion must have a numeric type (Double, Long, Integer, Short, Byte).


To define how to convert and display a currency for a metric:

1. Enter the number of **[!UICONTROL Decimal places]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Convert Concurrency]**.

1. Select the appropriate dimension from the list of dimensions that contains the currency code field.

1. Select a currency from the **[!UICONTROL Convert and display currency in]** list.

### Frequently Asked Questions

+++ How is currency conversion executed?

Upon report time, the value of the metric and original currency code are converted to USD and then converted to the currency configured for display. For this conversion, the daily currency exchange rates are used, applicable for the time of the event.

+++


+++ How far back are daily conversion rates maintained?

Daily conversion rates are maintained for the last four years.

+++


+++ What if I don't have a currency code field as part of my current data schema?

Several options exist for creating a new currency code field including Data Prep, Data Distiller and Derived Fields. Data Prep would be ideal for new implementations as it would be only on a go-forward basis. Depending on an organization's setup, Data Distiller and Derived Fields may be used to access the currency code values historically.
