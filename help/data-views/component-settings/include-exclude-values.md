# Include Exclude values component settings

Include Exclude values lets you create rules that depend on the value of a dimension item. Values that don't meet the criteria that you set are treated in Analysis Workspace as if they never existed, though the data still exists in the underlying dataset.

| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Set include/exclude values] | A checkbox that lets you enable conditions where data is included in a data view. |
| [!UICONTROL Case sensitive] | Visible on String schema data types. Defaults to on. This setting applies only to the [!UICONTROL Include/Exclude Values] logic, not to the resulting value. It allows you to specify if the rule is case sensitive. |
| [!UICONTROL Match] | Lets you specify which values you would like to consider for reporting prior to attribution and filters (e.g., only use values containing the phrase "error"). You can specify **[!UICONTROL If all criteria are met]** or **[!UICONTROL If any criteria are met]**. |
