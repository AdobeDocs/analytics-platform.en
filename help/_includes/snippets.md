## Time comparison {#apply-time-comparison}

You can compare the current time period to a previous time period. If you select an option in this menu, every data point receives a similarly colored dotted-lined counterpart. This counterpart represents that same metric in the selected previous date range. Setting this option doubles the number of items on the chart and rows in the table.

Available time comparison options include the previous period, 13 weeks prior, 52 weeks prior, and a Customized date range. If you select Customized date range, additional options appear to let you select the number and granularity. If you select None, the date comparison is removed.
