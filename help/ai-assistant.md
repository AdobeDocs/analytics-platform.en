# AI Assistant for Adobe Customer Journey Analytics

AI Assistant is a conversational experience that allows practitioners to perform tasks at a fast pace. Whether the task is to understand concepts, troubleshoot problems, or search through information. AI Assistant also allows non-experts to perform expert tasks and increases the overall quality of work.

The AI Assistant in Customer Journey Analytics is trained on its Adobe Experience League documentation. When asked a question, AI Assistant responds with a helpful answer that enables quick learning.

As a novice user, you can use AI Assistant to learn Customer Journey Analytics concepts and onboard yourself to products and features that you are unfamiliar with. As an experienced user, you can use AI Assistant to present more advanced use cases or tips and tricks.

Some examples of concept questions include:

* What is the difference between batch and streaming ingestion?
* What is Customer Journey Analytics best used for?
* How do I set up a data view?

Questions outside the scope of Customer Journey Analytics, such as questions about other Adobe products like Adobe Target and the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite, cannot be answered. 

AI Assistant for Customer Journey Analytics is available to all product tiers.
