Reporting on Content Analytics is done within Analysis Workspace. A specific Workspace [template](#template) is available, so you can immediately access a pre-populated Workspace project with relevant content insights.

To start reporting on Content Analytics from scratch:

1. [Create a new](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md) or [open an existing](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/open-projects.md) project in Workspace.
1. Drag a ![Table](/help/assets/icons/Table.svg) [Freeform table](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md) visualization on the canvas.
1. Use specific Content Analytics dimensions and metrics and other generic [components](/help/components/overview.md) (like filters, date ranges, annotations) to build your content analytics insights.

## Thumbnails

Based on the Content Analytics specific dimensions that you use in your project, thumbnails are displayed for assets and dimensions.

To open the preview with the following details:
