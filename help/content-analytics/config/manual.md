This article details the manual configuration actions you might require for making changes to your Content Analytics implementation. In general, you should use the [guided configuration wizard](guided.md) to make changes to your implementation but not all changes can be made using that configuration wizard.

The following manual configuration actions are available:

## Publish

To activate a Content Analytics configuration, you need to [publish](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/tags/publish/overview){target="_blank"} the associated Tag property. Only when you publish your Content Analytics Tag property, Content Analytics data is collected for the domains, experience and assets that you have configured
