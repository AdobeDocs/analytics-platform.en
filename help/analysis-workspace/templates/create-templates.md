# Create and manage templates

Administrators can create templates and save them for others in their login company to use.

People in the login company can use these company templates as described in [Use templates](/help/analysis-workspace/templates/use-templates.md).

## Create a template

<!-- is this only admins? -->

To create a new template that can be used by people in your login company:

1. In Analysis Workspace, build a project to your desired state.

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Project**] > **[!UICONTROL Save as template…]**.
   
   ![Company report](assets/company-template-save.png)

1. Specify the following information in the [!UICONTROL Save as template] dialog box:
   
   | Field | Description | 
   |---------|----------|
   | **[!UICONTROL Name]** | Provide a descriptive name for the template. | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Description]** | Provide a short description for the template that describes its intended uses. | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Why use this template]** | Provide a short explanation to inform people in the organization about how this template could be used. | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Channels]** | Choose any applicable channels that apply to this template. You can select multiple channels: **[!UICONTROL Web]**, **[!UICONTROL Mobile]**, **[!UICONTROL Cross-channel]**, **[!UICONTROL Call center]**, and **[!UICONTROL In-store]**.<p>The selections you choose determine where the template is displayed and which filters apply for users accessing it from the Organization Templates page.</p> | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Use cases]** | Choose any use cases that apply to this template. You can select multiple use cases: **[!UICONTROL Engagement]**, **[!UICONTROL Conversion]**, **[!UICONTROL Audience]**, and **[!UICONTROL Acquisition]**. <p>The selections you choose determine where the template is displayed and which filters apply for users accessing it from the Organization Templates page.</p> | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Tags]** | Specify any tags that you want to apply to the template. People can filter the list of templates by the tags you add. | 

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Save as template**]. 

For information about how users can create a project based on a template, see [Create a project based on a template](/help/analysis-workspace/templates/use-templates.md#create-a-project-based-on-a-template) in [Use templates](/help/analysis-workspace/templates/use-templates.md).

## Manage company templates

Administrators can delete, rename, tag, and approve company templates.  

To display and manage company templates:

1. In Analysis Workspace, select the [!UICONTROL **Workspace**] tab, then select the **[!UICONTROL Projects tab]** in the left rail.

1. Select the filter icon to filter the list of projects.

1. In the filter rail, select **OTHER FILTERS** and then select **Company templates**. 
    
   A list of the company templates are displayed. All regular projects, unless they're pinned, are not displayed.

   Company templates can be identified by the ![templates icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_FileTemplate_18_N.svg) that precedes the template name.
