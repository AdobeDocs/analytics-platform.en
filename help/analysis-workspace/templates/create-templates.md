# Create and manage templates

Administrators can create templates and save them for others in their login company to use.

People in the login company can use these company templates as described in [Use templates](/help/analysis-workspace/templates/use-templates.md).

To create a new template that can be used by people in your login company:

1. In Analysis Workspace, build a project to your desired state.

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Project**] > **[!UICONTROL Save as template…]**.

## Add missing components to the data view for a given template

By default, some templates provided by Adobe can't be used because they contain components that are not in your data view. 

For each missing component, a matching context label is available in your data view. You need to either add the matching context label to a component that is already in your data view, or you need to add a new component to your data view and add the context label to it. 

To add missing components to a template: 

1. In Analysis Workspace, select the [!UICONTROL **Workspace**] tab, then under **[!UICONTROL Templates]** in the left rail, select **[!UICONTROL Adobe templates]**.

1. Select the filter icon to filter the list of templates.
   
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Not ready for use]** to show templates that require components that are not in your data view.

      ![Use a template that is missing components](assets/template-not-ready.png)

1. Locate a template that is not yet ready to use with your data view.

1. Do either of the following:

   * **If you are viewing templates in a column view** ![column view icon](assets/column-view-icon.png):

     1. Go to the template that is not yet ready to use with your data view, then select the info icon next to the template name.

        ![Company template info](assets/company-template-info.png)

     1. Select **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.

         ![Template preview page](assets/template-preview.png)

   * **If you are viewing templates in a card view** ![card view icon](assets/card-view-icon.png):

        ![Template preview page](assets/template-preview.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Missing components]** section, a list of components that are missing from the data view are displayed. Select **[!UICONTROL Add these components to your data view]**.

   The configuration page for the data view is displayed in a new tab. 

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Components]** tab for the data view.

   ![Data view components tab](assets/template-dataview.png)

1. For each component that was listed as missing from the template, do either of the following on the **[!UICONTROL Components]** tab:

   * In the **[!UICONTROL Included components]** section, select a component that is already included in the data view that you want to use for the missing component. 

   * Add a new component to the data view that you want to use for the missing component, then select the component.
   
     To add a new component to the data view, search the list of schema fields, then drag it into the **[!UICONTROL Included components]** section.

1. With the component selected, locate the **[!UICONTROL Context labels]** drop-down menu in the right column.

1. For each missing component, repeat the process of adding the matching context label to a component in the data view.
