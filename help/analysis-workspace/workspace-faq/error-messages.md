Contributors to this error are timeouts due to the request's complexity. | Simplify your request.

## Troubleshooting

When using Analysis Workspae, you can use the information below to troubleshoot some common issues.

| Issue | How to troubleshoot |
|---|---|
| When I drag a metric over, it says *Invalid data*. | Invalid data means that Adobe cannot return data using the combination of dimensions and metrics used in the report. For example, two metrics stacked on top of each other cannot be returned as data, as there is no way to display two metrics that way. Instead, place the metrics side by side. |
| When I drag a metric over, I don't see any actual data - just zeros. | If you successfully created a workspace report but there's no data, there are a few things you can check:<ul><li>If you applied a filter in your report, the filter criteria might not match any data. Try removing the filter or adjusting the filter definition.</li><li>Check the date range in the upper right corner and make sure it's set to a value that you expect.</li><li>Navigate to your website and use the [Debugger](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/debugger/using/experience-cloud-debugger.html) to validate that data is being collected.</li></ul> |
