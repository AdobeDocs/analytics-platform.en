# Data storytelling: Generate slide presentations from Workspace reports {#generate-powerpoint}

{{release-limited-testing}}

<!-- also remove lmited testing note from: /help/technotes/access-control.md -->

Users with [the necessary permissions](#permission-requirements-to-generate-slides) can automatically generate .pptx presentations based on Analysis Workspace projects. When generating these slide presentations, Customer Journey Analytics automatically creates a story from your data by identifying key insights and converting them into stakeholder-ready slides. 

This generated data story reduces the time, effort, and expertise required to surface findings from a Workspace project. Analysts can focus more on data exploration, while allowing Customer Journey Analytics to build and format the executive narrative and communicate the business impact to stakeholders.

## Understand data stories in slide presentations

A **data story** is the narrative that Customer Journey Analytics creates based on your Workspace data. Using generative AI, Customer Journey Analytics identifies important themes within the panels and visualizations that you choose to include in your slide presentation. It generates insights, then goes through a deduplication and scoring process to identify a subset of insights to use to create the data story. 

The following sections describe the additional value that data stories provide, the necessary elements of a project that help shape the narrative, and key elements that are included in the .pptx presentation output. 

### Additional value provided by data stories

Data stories provide value and insights to a Workspace project by making data accessible to users who are less experienced in data analysis. 

Data stories supplement an analysis for a given Workspace project by:

* Providing additional context

* Highlighting important insights

* Assessing whether certain variables are being under-valued or over-valued 

* Calling out hidden trends, anomalies, and other contributing factors

* Giving ideas for next steps

### Project elements that shape data stories

Analysis Workspace creates data stories by considering the following project elements:

* Inter-dimension and inter-metric relationships

* The individual elements that form the basis of the analysis (dimensions, metrics, filters, freeform table structure, visualizations, and panels) 

* The names given to the panels, tables and visualizations

* The ordering of metrics in a freeform table (to determine priority)

* The ordering of visualizations in a panel (to determine priority)

* Summary numbers and summary texts (to determine metrics that need to be highlighted in the data story)

### Presentation elements of a data story

Data stories consist of a title slide, executive summary slide, detail slides, and section dividers.

**Title slide:** Shows the title and presenter name that you specify. Information shows in the speaker notes that describes the process of how the theme and narrative were created, how many insights were generated and used, and which panels were used.

**Executive summary:** Prioritizes the highest-value insights and crafts an overarching story that is between 1 and 5 sentences in length.

**Detail slides:** Generates insights related to any tables, panels, or visualizations in a Workspace project. Insights consist of trends, seasonalities, anomalies, and correlations.

**Section dividers:** Divides insights with appropriately placed and named section dividers.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD034 -->

1. Go to the Workspace project that contains the data that you want to use as the basis of your slide presentation.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Generate slides]** in the upper-right corner of the page.

   The Generate slides dialog displays.

   ![Generate slides dialog](assets/generate-slides.png)

1. Specify the following information:

   |Option | Description | 
   |---------|----------|
   | **[!UICONTROL Cover title]** | Specify a title for the presentation. This title appears on the title slide of the presentation.  | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Include presenter name]** | Specify the name of the presenter. This name appears on the title slide of the presentation, below the cover title. | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Panels and visualizations to include]** | Choose the panels and visualization that you want to include in the presentation. You can include up to 50 visualizations.<p>Most panels and visualizations are supported. For information about unsupported panels and visualization, see [Unsupported project elements and features](#unsupported-project-elements-and-features).</p> | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Panel and visualization descriptions]** | Choose whether to include panel and visualization descriptions in your generated slide presentation. | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Annotations]** | Choose whether annotations are visible in your generated slide presentation. For more information about annotations, see [Annotations overview](/help/components/annotations/overview.md).  | 
   | **[!UICONTROL Emphasize components]** | Choose the metrics and dimensions from your visualizations that you want to emphasize in the presentation. The components you choose are ranked higher and given more weight when the themes and overarching narrative of the data story is created. <p>When no emphasis is applied, components show in presentations as follows:<ul><li>**Metrics and dimensions:** Italics</li><li>**Dimension items:** Quotation marks</li></ul></p><p>When emphasis is applied, components show in presentations as follows:</p><ul><li>**Metrics and dimensions:** Italics and bold</li><li>**Dimension items:** Bold when the corresponding dimension is emphasized<p>A color is also applied to the dimension item when the dimension item is highlighted in the chart.</p></li></ul> | 

1. (Conditional) Select **[!UICONTROL Default theme]** if you want to generate slides in fewer steps, and if a corporate theme is not required for your slide presentation. 

   Simply choose the color theme of your presentation by selecting the desired color.

   ![Generate slides with the default theme](assets/generate-slides-default-theme.png)

1. (Conditional) Select **[!UICONTROL Upload template]** if your slide presentation needs to match a corporate theme. This option requires that you upload a custom template and apply your custom styles. 

   The most recent custom template you upload is stored locally in your browser cache, and is available when generating future slide presentations.

   ![Generate slides with a custom template](assets/generate-slides-upload-template.png)

   To upload a custom template, do either of the following:
   
   * (Recommended) Download a blank template and modify it. 

     1. Download [this blank template](https://d30ln29764hddd.cloudfront.net/deploy/builds/data-storytelling.2025-10-20T15:10:19/resources/components/Blank.potx?).

     1. Apply your custom styles to the blank template.

     1. Re-upload the template without changing any master layout names:

        From your file system, drag your blank template that has your custom styles applied to the drop area.
     
        Or
        
        Select **[!UICONTROL Browse]**, then browse to and select your blank template that has your custom styles applied from the file system. 

     1. In the **[!UICONTROL Layout mapping]** section, each slide layout that is used in generated presentations is automatically mapped to a slide from your uploaded theme. Review the selections to make sure they are correct.

        ![Layout mapping](assets/generate-slides-layout-mapping.png)
     
     1. (Conditional) If a slide layout is mapped incorrectly, select **[!UICONTROL Change selection]** above the slide that was chosen from your uploaded presentation, then choose the slide that matches the layout. 

        Repeat this process for each slide that was incorrectly mapped.

   * Upload a custom template directly. 
   
     1. From your file system, drag your custom template to the drop area.
     
        Or
        
        Select **[!UICONTROL Browse]**, then browse to and select your custom template from the file system. 
        
        Make sure that the uploaded file has master layouts with the following names: "Title_Slide," "Section_Divider," "Title_Text," "Title_Chart," "Title_Two_Content_Mixed," "Title_Three_Content_Mixed."

        .pptx and .potx files up to 25MB in size are supported.

     1. In the **[!UICONTROL Layout mapping]** section, each slide layout that is used in generated presentations is automatically mapped to a slide from your uploaded theme. Review the selections to make sure they are correct.

        ![Layout mapping custom template](assets/generate-slides-layout-mapping-custom-template.png)
     
     1. (Conditional) If a slide layout is mapped incorrectly, select **[!UICONTROL Change selection]** above the slide that was chosen from your uploaded presentation, then choose the slide that matches the layout. 

        Repeat this process for each slide that was incorrectly mapped.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Export PPT]**.

   The .pptx presentation is automatically downloaded to your workstation. 

1. (Recommended) Open the .pptx presentation and review it. Make any needed changes.
