# Data storytelling: Generate slide presentations from Workspace reports {#generate-powerpoint}

You can automatically generate .pptx presentations from Analysis Workspace projects. When generating presentations, Customer Journey Analytics automatically identifies key insights and converts them into stakeholder-ready slides. 

This functionality reduces the time and effort required to surface findings from your Workspace projects, and it allows you to quickly build executive narratives and communicate business impact.
