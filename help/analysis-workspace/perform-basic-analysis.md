Its feature set differs slightly from [Analysis Workspace in traditional Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/home.html). [Learn more...](/help/getting-started/cja-aa.md)

After you have created connections and data views, analyze the data you have brought in using the power and flexibility of Analysis Workspace. Feel free to experiment and drag in dimensions and metrics, change dimension and metrics attribution settings, friendly names, time zone, session settings, etc.

Here is a sample of basic visualizations in Workspace. For example, you can

* Create a ranked report of which data sources show the most events, sessions, and people.

* Create a trended report of online versus in-store revenue that compares the two data sources over time.

* Depict audience size by data sources, such as ad impression data, Customer Journey Analytics data, email data, POS data, call center data, and survey data.
