# Summary number and Summary change

Use the ![Summarize](/help/assets/icons/123.svg) **[!UICONTROL Summary number]** visualization to highlight a large number that is important in a project. This visualization behaves in the following ways, using the associated data source:

* Selects the total of the column if no cell is selected.
* If a single cell is selected, it shows the summary for that cell.
* If more than one cell is selected, it shows the first cell selected.
* If the column is selected, it picks the first cell value in the column.

As part of the visualization settings, specific Summary number options are available.

| Option | Definition |
|--- |--- |
| **[!UICONTROL Abbreviate value]** | Select **[!UICONTROL Abbreviate value]** to abbreviate intelligently the number value. When selected, enter a number to define the amount of abbreviation. For example:<br/><table><tr><td>**Original value**</td><td>**Abbreviation value**</td><td>**Result**</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td>Not selected</td><td  align="right">$12,011,141.25</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td>Selected, set to `0`</td><td align="right">$12M</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td> Selected, set to `1`</td><td  align="right">$12.0M</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td>Selected, set to `2`</td><td align="right">$12.01M</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td>Selected, set to `3`</td><td align="right">$12.011M</td></tr></table> |
| **[!UICONTROL Summarize value by]** | Choose to display the max, min, mean, median, or sum for a selection of data. |

## Summary change {#summary-change}

Use the ![MoveUpDown](/help/assets/icons/MoveUpDown.svg) **[!UICONTROL Summary Change]** visualization to show the delta (change) between two numbers. <!-- This is applicable for AA, not CJA: The green and red color of the Summary Change can be controlled through [custom event polarity](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/success-events/success-event.html) or a calculated metric's [Show Upward Trend As](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/calculated-metrics/calcmetric-workflow/cm-build-metrics.html) option.-->

-->

This visualization behaves in the following ways:

* If no cell is selected, it compares the first two cell values in the column.
* If one cell is selected, it shows 0, because it compares the cell value to itself.
* If two cells are selected, the first selected cell is taken as numerator and the second as denominator.
* If more than two cells are selected, it only considers the first two for comparison.
* If a range of cells is selected, it compares the first to the last cells selected in the range.
* If the column is selected, it compares the first value to itself, which shows a change of 0.

As part of the visualization settings, specific **[!UICONTROL Summary change options]** are available.

| Option | Definition |
|--- |--- |
| **[!UICONTROL Show percent change]**| Show the percent change between the 2 numbers.|
| **[!UICONTROL Show raw difference]** | Show the raw difference between the 2 numbers. You can also abbreviate values and show up to 3 decimal places with this option.|
| **[!UICONTROL Abbreviate value]** | Select **[!UICONTROL Abbreviate value]** to abbreviate intelligently the changed value. When selected, enter a number to define the amount of abbreviation. For example:<br/><table><tr><td>**Original value**</td><td>**Abbreviation value**</td><td>**Result**</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td>Not selected</td><td  align="right">$12,011,141.25</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td>Selected, set to `0`</td><td align="right">$12M</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td> Selected, set to `1`</td><td  align="right">$12.0M</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td>Selected, set to `2`</td><td align="right">$12.01M</td></tr><tr><td>$12,011,141.25</td><td>Selected, set to `3`</td><td align="right">$12.011M</td></tr></table> |
