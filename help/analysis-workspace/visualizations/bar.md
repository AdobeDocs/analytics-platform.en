# Bar and bar stacked

## Bar

This visualization shows vertical bars representing various values across one or more metrics.

A granularity drop-down in the visualization settings lets you change a trended visualization (e.g. line, bar) from daily to weekly to monthly, etc.

## Bar stacked

This visualization is like a bar chart, but with the series bars stacked on top of each other.

Use the **[!UICONTROL 100% stacked]** option in ![Setting](/help/assets/icons/Setting.svg) **[!UICONTROL Settings]** to turn the chart into a 100% stacked visualization.
