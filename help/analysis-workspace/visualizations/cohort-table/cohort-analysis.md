# What is [!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis]?

A *`cohort`* is a group of people sharing common characteristics over a specified period. [!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis] is useful, for example, when you want to learn how a cohort engages with a brand. You can easily spot changes in trends, then respond accordingly. (Explanations of [!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis] are available on the web, such as at [Cohort Analysis 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_analysis).)

After creating a cohort report, you can curate its components (specific dimensions, metrics, and filters), then share the cohort report with anyone. See [Curate and Share](/help/analysis-workspace/curate-share/curate.md).

Examples of what you can do with [!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis]:

* Launch campaigns designed to spur a desired action.
* Shift marketing budget at exactly the right time in the customer lifecycle.
* Recognize when to end a trial or an offer, in order to maximize value.
* Gain ideas for A/B testing in areas such as pricing, upgrade path, and so on.

[!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis] is available for all Customer Journey Analytics customers with access rights to [!UICONTROL Analysis Workspace].

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>[!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis] does not support non-filterable metrics (including calculated metrics), non-integer metrics (such as Revenue), or Occurrences. Only metrics that can be used in filters can be used in [!UICONTROL Cohort Analysis], and they can only be incremented 1 at a time. 

## Cohort Analysis capabilities

The following capabilities allow for fine-tuned control over the cohorts you are building:

### [!UICONTROL Retention] Table

A [!UICONTROL Retention] cohort report returns persons: each data cell shows the raw number and percentage of persons in the cohort who did the action during that time period. You can include up to 3 metrics and up to 10 filters.

### [!UICONTROL Churn] Table

A [!UICONTROL Churn] cohort is the inverse of a retention table and shows the persons who fell out or never met the return criteria for your cohort over time. You can include up to 3 metrics and up to 10 filters.

### [!UICONTROL Rolling Calculation]

Lets you calculate retention or churn based on the previous column, not the included column.

### [!UICONTROL Latency] Table

Measures the time that has elapsed before and after the inclusion event occurred. This is an excellent tool for pre/post analysis. The **[!UICONTROL Included]** column is in the center of the table and time periods before and after the inclusion event are shown on both sides.

### [!UICONTROL Custom Dimension] Cohort

Create cohorts based on a selected dimension, and not time-based cohorts, which are the default. Use dimensions such as [!UICONTROL marketing channel], [!UICONTROL campaign], [!UICONTROL product], [!UICONTROL page], [!UICONTROL region], or any other dimension in Customer Journey Analytics to show how retention changes based on the different values of these dimensions.
