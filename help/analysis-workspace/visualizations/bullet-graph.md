Lets you see how a value you are interested in compares to or measures against other performance ranges (goals).

 ![Visualization Settings window showing the Chart type option, Bullet Options, and other chart settings.](assets/bullet-image.png)

The bullet graph features a single, primary measure (for example, current year-to-date revenue) and allows you to enter qualitative ranges performance ranges (for example, compared to a target revenue). You can specify high, medium, and low. You can specify goal ranges in [!UICONTROL Visualization Settings].
