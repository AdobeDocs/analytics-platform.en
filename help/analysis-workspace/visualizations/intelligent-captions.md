# Intelligent captions

Intelligent captions use advanced Machine Learning and Generative AI to provide valuable natural-language insights for Workspace visualizations. The initial release provides auto-generated insights for the [Line](line.md) visualization. Other visualizations will follow. 

Intelligent captions are geared towards:

* Analysts, who need narratives to share with other users. Analysts need these insights to be able to provide context to their users.
* Business users, who want to discover high-level takeaways quickly.

## Launch intelligent captions {#launch}

To launch auto-generated captions for a line visualization, select ![AEMScreen](/help/assets/icons/AI.svg) **[!UICONTROL Intelligent captions]** at the top right of the visualization.

![Launch Analysis window showing the Intelligent captions for Product Views Trend. ](assets/intell-caps-1.png)

Natural-language insights are now being generated. 

Keep in mind that:

* You need a minimum of 3 data points to generate captions successfully. Otherwise, you might get an error like **[!UICONTROL Not enough data to analyze]**.

* Captions are generated every time the underlying selected data changes in the table that powers the visualization. 

* If there are multiple metrics in the table, captions are only generated for the first metric or the metric currently selected by the user.

* If you save the project at a specific point, and re-load it later, the captions are auto-updated with new data. The same applies to scheduled projects and PDF files exported from a project.

Here is an example of what intelligent captions could look like:
