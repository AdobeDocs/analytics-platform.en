# Intelligent captions

Intelligent captions uses advanced Generative AI to provide key insights for the most frequently used Workspace visualizations in natural language. 

Intelligent captions are geared towards:

* Analysts, who need narratives to share with other users. Analysts need these insights to be able to provide context to their users.
* Business users, who want to discover high-level takeaways quickly.

## Launch intelligent captions {#launch}

To launch auto-generated intelligent captions for a visualization, select ![Intelligent captions](/help/assets/icons/AI.svg) at the top right of the visualization. This selection generates natural-language insights. 

![Launch Analysis window showing the Intelligent captions for Product Views Trend. ](assets/intelligent-captions.gif)


Keep in mind that:

* You need a minimum of 3 data points to generate captions successfully. Otherwise, you might get an error like **[!UICONTROL Not enough data to analyze]**.

* Captions are generated every time the underlying selected data changes in the table that powers the visualization. 

* If there are multiple metrics in an associated freeform table, captions are only generated for the first metric or the metric currently selected by the user. However, captions can be generated for multiple metrics for the line and area visualizations. 

* If you save the project at a specific point, and re-load it later, the captions are auto-updated with new data. The same applies to scheduled projects and PDF files exported from a project.


## Visualizations

Intelligent captions are supported on the following visualizations:

* [Line](line.md) (including multi-line)
* [Bar](bar.md)
* [Horizontal bar](horizontal-bar.md)
* [Area](area.md) (including multiple Area lines)
* [Donut](donut.md)
* [Fallout](fallout/fallout-flow.md)
* [Flow](c-flow/flow.md)
