Use a ![GraphTree](/help/assets/icons/GraphTree.svg) **[!UICONTROL Treemap]** visualization to display hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a set of nested rectangles.

Each branch of the tree is given a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches.

With a treemap, you can see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways. Using the color and size of the dimensions you can discover how dimensions are correlated and if a certain dimension is particularly relevant. A second advantage of treemaps is that, by construction, treemaps make efficient use of space.
