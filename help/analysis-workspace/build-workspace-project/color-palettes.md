# Visualization color palette

You can change the visualization color palette used in Workspace by choosing a different color palette or by specifying your own palette that could match your company's branding colors. This feature affects most visualizations in Workspace, but it does **not** affect Summary Change, conditional formatting in Freeform tables, and the Map visualization.

>Color palette support is not enabled for Internet Explorer 11.

Keep in mind:

* There are five pre-set color palettes to choose from. The default palette and the one below have been optimized for contrast and are both more accessible for those who are color blind.
* The third to the fifth color palettes below the top two have been optimized for color harmony.

## Change your color palette:

1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Workspace]** > **[!UICONTROL Project]** > **[!UICONTROL Project Info & Settings]**.
1. From the **[!UICONTROL Project Color Palette]** drop-down list, you can pick one of five pre-set color schemes.

1. To specify your own palette, select **[!UICONTROL Custom Palette]** below the pre-set options.
1. Specify up to 16 comma-separated hexadecimal values (for example, #00a4e4) for the colors you intend to use. If, for example, you want to use only four values, these colors will be automatically be repeated in visualizations that contain more colors.
