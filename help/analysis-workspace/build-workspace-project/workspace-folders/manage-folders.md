# Manage folders

You can manage folders in Workspace in two ways. From within the folder, or from one or more selected folders in the project list. Manage folders include renaming, moving or deleting folders.

## Rename folders

You can only rename folders that you create, unless you are an administrator. An administrator can rename any folder.

To rename folders in Workspace:

* Select a folder that you want to rename in the [Project list](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#project-list).

  1. Select **[!UICONTROL Rename]** from the [actions](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#actions) available from the context menu ![More](/help/assets/icons/More.svg) of the selected folder, or the blue action bar.
  1. In the **[!UICONTROL Rename: *folder name*]** dialog, enter a new name and select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Delete folders 

You can only delete folders that you create, unless you are an administrator. An administrator can delete any folder.

When you delete a folder, the following guidelines apply:

* Deleting a folder does not delete the contents of the folder. The contents of a deleted folder (projects or sub-folders) are moved to the parent folder in the hierarchy.
* Administrators can delete a folder within the Company folder that another administrators have created. Administrators need to coordinate with other administrators to keep folder and project access consistent.

To delete folders in Workspace, 

* Select one or more folders that you want to delete in the [Project list](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#project-list).

  1. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** from the [actions](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#actions) available from the context menu ![More](/help/assets/icons/More.svg) of the selected folder, or the blue action bar.

  1. In the **[!UICONTROL Are you sure?]** dialog, select **[!UICONTROL OK]** to delete the folders.

* Within the folder that you want to delete.
