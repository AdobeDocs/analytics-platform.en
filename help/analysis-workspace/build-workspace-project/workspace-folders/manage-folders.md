# Manage folders

You can manage folders in Workspace in two ways. From within the folder or from one or more selected folders in the project list. Manage folders include renaming, moving or deleting folders.

## Rename folders

You can rename folders that you create. You cannot rename folders that you did not create, unless you are an administrator.

To rename folders in Workspace:

* Select a folder you want to rename in the [Project list](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#project-list).

  1. Select **[!UICONTROL Rename]** from the [actions](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#actions) available from the context menu ![More](/help/assets/icons/More.svg) of the selected folder, or the blue action bar.
  1. In the **[!UICONTROL Rename: *folder name*]** dialog enter a new name and select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

* Within the folder you want to rename.
  
  1. Select **[!UICONTROL Rename folder]** from ![More](/help/assets/icons/More.svg) in the [Title area](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#title-area).

  1. In the **[!UICONTROL Rename: *folder name*]** dialog enter a new name and select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.


## Move folders

You can move folders that you create. You cannot move folders that you did not create, unless you are an administrator.

To move folders in Workspace:

* Select a folder you want to move in the [Project list](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#project-list).

  1. Select **[!UICONTROL Move to]** from the [actions](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#actions) available from the context menu ![More](/help/assets/icons/More.svg) of the selected folder, or the blue action bar.
  1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select Folder]** dialog, select a folder from the **[!UICONTROL Folder]** dropdown list to move the folder to.

  1. Select **[!UICONTROL Move]**.

* Within the folder you want to move.

  1. In the **[!UICONTROL Select Folder]** dialog, select a folder from the **[!UICONTROL Folder]** dropdown list to move the folder to.

  1. Select **[!UICONTROL Move]**.


## Delete folders 

You can delete folders that you create. You cannot delete folders that you did not create, unless you are an administrator.

When you delete a folder, the following guidelines apply:

* Deleting a folder does not delete the contents of the folder. The contents of a deleted folder (projects or sub-folders) are moved to the parent folder in the hierarchy.
* Administrators can delete a folder within the Company folder that another administrators have created. Administrators need to coordinate with other administrators to keep folder and project access consistent.

To delete folders in Workspace, 

   * Select one or more folders you want to delete in the [Project list](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#project-list).

     1. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** from the [actions](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#actions) available from the context menu ![More](/help/assets/icons/More.svg) of the selected folder, or the blue action bar.

     1. In the **[!UICONTROL Are you sure?]** dialog, select **[!UICONTROL OK]** to delete the folders.

   * Within the folder you want to delete. 
     
     1. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete folder]** from ![More](/help/assets/icons/More.svg) in the [Title area](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md#title-area).

     1. In the **[!UICONTROL Delete *name* folder?]** dialog, select **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
