# About folders in Analysis Workspace

Folders in Customer Journey Analytics are available on the Workspace landing page when you have selected to [Show Folders & Projects](../freeform-overview.md#show-selector).

Folders in Workspace help you to organize and categorize your projects. With the folders functionality, you can create folders and sub-folders to manage your projects. 

There are two types of folders in Workspace: the Company folder and personal folders. A shared Company folder allows administrators to create and share content with all Workspace users. 

When you selected [Show Folders & Projects](../freeform-overview.md#show-selector), the Projects home page displays a list of your projects along with the Company folder and any personal folders that you created. Otherwise, you just see a list of your projects.


## Company folder

The Company folder is a shared-access folder for projects that administrators can share with all users.

As an administrator, you can quickly share projects with all users and group projects into subfolders for a user group. For example, you have a set of projects that you want your marketers to use to start their research. Then you can create a Marketing folder within the Company folder then place selected projects within the Marketing folder. This folder provides direct access to shared projects and it makes it easier for the Marketing team to know where to look for common projects.

When you log in to Workspace, the Company folder is automatically added to your project and folder list. There are no specific permissions for projects contained within the Company folder.

### Administrator options

Administrators have special privileges assigned to the Company folder. For example, only administrators can add or remove folders or projects in the Company folder. Users without administration access control can view the contents of the Company folder.

### Guidelines

Below are some guidelines when working with the Company folder:

- Administrators can add projects to the Company folder or create a new project and save the new project to the Company folder. Non-administrators can view the contents of the Company folder.

- Administrators can create subfolders within the Company folder.

- Administrators can delete a folder within the Company folder that another administrator created. Administrators may need to coordinate with other administrators to keep folder and project access consistent.

- When an administrator moves a project to the Company folder, the folder is shared with everyone even if the original shared privileges were restricted. 
- When an administrator moves a project out of the Company folder, the original or previous sharing privileges are respected.

- When an administrator moves a project out of the Company folder, the original or previous sharing privileges are respected.
