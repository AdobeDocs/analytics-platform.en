# Remove a Project from a Folder

To remove a project from a folder, you can move the project to another location or delete the project.

>When an Admin moves a project to the Company Folder, the folder is shared with everyone even if the original shared privileges were restricted. When an Admin moves a project out of the Company Folder, the original or previous sharing privileges are respected.
