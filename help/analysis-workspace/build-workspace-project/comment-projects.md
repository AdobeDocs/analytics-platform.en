# Add and manage comments in projects {#comment-on-projects}

Comments in Analysis Workspace allow you to share insights and ask questions within the context of an Analysis Workspace project. This can streamline discussions about the data, keeping conversations within the context of the data that is being discussed. 

## View comments

### View the comments area

All comments made in an Analysis Workspace project are visible in the comments area in the right rail. 

1. With the project open in Analysis Workspace, select the comments area icon in the right rail of Analysis Workspace.

### View comment badges in a project

Comments that are made on a specific area of the project have a **comment badge** ![comment badge](assets/comment-indicator.png) that displays over the area of the project that the comment pertains to. You can view the comment either by selecting the badge or [viewing the comments area](#view-the-comments-area).

Numbers display on each badge in a project and are ordered in the order they were created. If multiple comments are placed in the same area of a project, the badge shows 3 dots ![comment badge multiple](assets/comment-indicator-multiple.png). Select the 3-dot badge to reveal all comments in that area.

## Include others in a comment

The comment feature in Analysis Workspace makes it easier to collaborate with others. To include another person in your comment:

1. Type the @ symbol, then begin typing the name of the person you want to include.

1. Select the person's name when it appears in the drop-down menu.

Consider the following when using the @ symbol to include people in a comment: 
   
* People you include receive an email notification and a Pulse notification.

* You can include anyone in your organization in a comment, but this does not automatically grant them access to the project. Only people who already have access to the project can access it.

1. Select the more icon ![comment-more-icon](assets/comment-more-icon.png) next to the comment whose link you want to copy, then select **[!UICONTROL Copy link]**. 

   The link is copied to your system clipboard. You can paste the link in an email or other type of message.
