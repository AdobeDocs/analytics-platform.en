[Projects](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/freeform-overview.md) in Analysis Workspace allow you to create and view business-critical analyses.  These analyses can be shared with stakeholders inside or outside your organization. 

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, select **[!UICONTROL Workspace]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Projects]** in the left panel, then select **[!UICONTROL Create project]**.

1. Select **Blank Workspace project** to create your Workspace project using a browser.

   See [Blank mobile scorecard](/help/mobile-app/curator.md) for more information on how to create a Mobile scorecard project that you can share with other stakeholders using a mobile app. And see [Guided analysis](/help/guided-analysis/overview.md) for  more information on the various options available to create your guided analysis project.

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Create**].


Now that you have created a Blank Workspace project, ensure you are familiar with the [Analysis Workspace](/help/analysis-workspace/home.md) user interface. Once you are, you can build your project. To do so:

  ![Example project](assets/example-project.png)

* Add [panels](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md) to your project. For example, the **[!DNL Example Panel]** ➊.
   
* Add [visualizations](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md) to your panels. For example: 
  * **[!DNL Line Graph]** [Line](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/line.md) visualization ➋  
  * **[!DNL Countries]** [Freeform table](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md) visualization ➌
* Add [components](/help/components/overview.md) to your visualizations. For example:
  * **[!DNL Store Country]** [dimension](/help/components/dimensions/overview.md) ➍
  * **[!DNL People]** [metric](/help/components/apply-create-metrics.md) ➎ 
  * **[!DNL Avg Order Value]** [calculated metric](/help/components/calc-metrics/calc-metr-overview.md) ➏ 
  * **[!DNL Mobile App Sessions]** [filter](/help/components/filters/filters-overview.md) ➐
  * **[!DNL Last Month]** [date range](/help/components/date-ranges/overview.md) ➑ 
  * **[!DNL Example]** [annotation](/help/components/annotations/overview.md) ➒
