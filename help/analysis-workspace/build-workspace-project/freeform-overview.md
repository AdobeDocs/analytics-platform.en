# Projects overview
 
Workspace projects allow you to combine panels, visualizations and components to craft your analysis and share with anyone in your organization. Before you start your first project, learn about how to access, navigate and manage your projects.  

To access projects in Customer Journey Analytics, select **[!UICONTROL Workspace]**.  The **[!UICONTROL Projects]** manager lists all the projects that you own or projects that are shared with you. The Project manager with the Project list is also the default landing page for Customer Journey Analytics, unless you have configured otherwise in Preferences.

To hide the area with tiles, select ![ChevronDown](/help/assets/icons/ChevronDown.svg) **[!UICONTROL Show less]**.

### Project Info & Settings {#info-settings}

**[!UICONTROL Workspace]** > **[!UICONTROL Project]** > **[!UICONTROL Project info & settings]** provides project-level information on the currently active project.

![The Project Info & Settings window.](assets/projectinfo.png)

Settings include:

|  Setting  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Project Name  | The name given to the project. You can double-click the name to edit it.  |
|  Created By  | Project owner name  |
|  Last Modified  | Date of last modification to the project.  |
|  Tags  |Lists any tags applied to a project for easier categorization.  |
|  Description  | A description is useful for clarifying the purpose of a project. You can double-click the description to edit it.  |

|  [Project color palette](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/color-palettes.md)  | You can change the categorical color palette used in Workspace, by choosing from out-of-the-box palettes that have been optimized for color blindness, or by specifying your custom palette. This feature affects many things in Workspace, including most visualizations.  |
| [View Density](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/view-density.md) | Lets you see more data on the screen by reducing the vertical padding of the left panel, freeform tables and cohort tables. |

## Left panel

Within a project, various icons are available in the left panel, and each represents important parts of a project:

* [Panels](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md) ![panels icon](assets/panels-icon.png)

* [Visualizations](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md)![visualizations icon](assets/visualizations-icon.png)

* [Components](/help/components/overview.md)![components icon](assets/components-icon.png)

* [Data dictionary](/help/components/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-overview.md)![data dictionary icon](assets/data-dictionary-icon.png)

* [Table of contents](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/project-table-of-contents.md) ![toc icon](assets/toc-icon.png)

Components (Dimensions, Metrics, Filters, Date Ranges) in the left panel relate to the active panel data view. The active panel is identified by the blue border that surrounds it, and the active data view is listed at the top of the component panel.

![The components relating to the active panel data view for Cross-Industry Demo Data data view.](assets/left-rail.png)

## Project canvas {#canvas}

The project canvas is where you bring together panels, tables, visualizations, and components to build your analysis. A project can contain many panels, and each panel can contain many tables and visualizations.

Panels are helpful when you want to organize your projects according to time periods, data views, or analysis use case. The active panel will have a blue border around it, and determines what components are available in the left panel.

Depending on the starting point you chose for your projects, you will either have a [freeform table](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md) or a [blank panel](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/blank-panel.md) in the canvas to begin with. The quickest way to start analyzing is to select one or many components and simply drag & drop them into the project canvas. A table of data will automatically be rendered for you. [Learn more](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md) about the different options for building a table, or leverage our [training tutorial](/help/analysis-workspace/home.md) for more guidance on building your first project.

![A Freeform Table for the project.](assets/canvas.png)

## Project Manager {#manager}

Analysis Workspace projects can be managed under **Analytics > Components >  Projects**. The Project Manager shows the projects that a specific user created. You can transfer project ownership to a new user under Admin > Analytics Users & Assets > Transfer Assets.

In Projects Manager, you can add, tag, share, duplicate/copy, and more. Search for a project in the search bar or by using the filter options in the left panel. You can filter by tag, owners, project type and more.

![Project Manager Tags search field and Title search field.](assets/project-manager.png)

The following are common actions in the Projects manager, and can be taken on one or many projects at once:

|  Action  | Description  |
|---|---|
|  Add  | Create a new project from scratch.  |
|  Tag or Approve  | Choose "Tag" or "Approve" to organize your projects and make them easier to search for.  |
|  [Share](/help/analysis-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.md)  | Make a project available to other Analysis Workspace users in your organization.  |
|  Delete  | Delete your project.  |
|  Rename  | Edit the name of your project.  |
|  Copy  | Create a duplicate copy of your project. This creates a new project and project ID. Any shares or schedules tied to the original project will not be copied. |
|  Export to CSV  | Download your project as a CSV file, which includes plain-text data.  |
