# Manage connections

Once you have [created or edited one or more connections](/help/connections/create-connection.md), you can manage them in **[!UICONTROL Connections]**. Connections let you:

* View all your connections at a glance, including the owner, the sandbox, and when the connections were created and modified.
* Edit a connection.
* Delete a connection.
* Create a data view from a connection.
* View all datasets in a connection.
* Check the status of your connection's datasets and the status of the ingestion process. For example, when is your data available so that you can start with reporting and analysis in Analysis Workspace.
* Identify any data discrepancies due to misconfiguration. Are you missing any rows? If so, what rows are missing and why? Did you misconfigure connections and cause missing data in Customer Journey Analytics?


A table shows all connections available. You can quickly search for a connection using the Search ![Search](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Search_18_N.svg) box.

The following columns / icons are available in the table.

| Column / Icon | Description |

| User Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Edit](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Edit_18_N.svg) [!UICONTROL Edit Connection] | To edit the details of a connection, select ![Edit](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Edit_18_N.svg) **[!UICONTROL Edit Connection]** . See [Create or edit a connection](create-connection.md) for more information. |
| Dataset selector | Lets you pick one or all datasets in the connection. You cannot multi-select datasets. Defaults to [!UICONTROL All datasets]. |
| Date range selector | Edit start and/or end date or select ![Calendar](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Calendar_18_N.svg) to open the data range selector. In the date range selector, select a date range by using one of the predefined periods (for example **[!UICONTROL Last 6 months]**) or use the calendar to select start and end date. Select **[!UICONTROL Apply]** to apply the new data range.|
| [!UICONTROL Records of event data available] | Represents the total number of event dataset rows available for reporting, **for the entire connection**. This count is independent of any calendar settings. The count changes if you select a dataset from the dataset selector or by selecting a dataset in the table. Once data is added, there is a latency of 1-2 hours to get the data to appear in reporting. |
| [!UICONTROL Metrics] | Summarizes the event records added/skipped/deleted, and the number of batches added, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**.<p>Select **[!UICONTROL Check detail]** to show the **[!UICONTROL Check skipped detail]** popup, listing for all event datasets or selected dataset the number of skipped records and the reason.<p><img src="./assets/skipped-records.png" width="70%"/><p>Select ![Info](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_InfoOutline_18_N.svg) popup with more information. For some skipped reasons, like [!UICONTROL Empty visitor ID], the popup displays Sample PSQL for EQS (Experience Platform for Query Service) you can use in [Query Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/query/home.html?lang=en) to query for the skipped records in the dataset. Select ![Copy](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Copy_18_N.svg) **[!UICONTROL Copy sample PSQL for EQS]** to copy the SQL. |
| [!UICONTROL Records added] | Indicates how many rows were added in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Updated every 10 minutes. |
| [!UICONTROL Records skipped] | Indicates how many rows were skipped in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Reasons for skipping records include: missing timestamps, missing or invalid person ID, and so forth. Updated every 10 minutes. <p>Invalid person IDs (such as "undefined", or "00000000", or any combination of numbers and letters in a [!UICONTROL Person ID] that appears in an event more than 1 million times in a given month) cannot be attributed to any specific user or person. They cannot be ingested into the system and result in error-prone ingestion and reporting. To fix invalid person IDs, you have 3 options:<ul><li>Use [Stitching](/help/stitching/overview.md) to populate the undefined or all-zero user IDs with valid user IDs.</li><li>Blank out the user ID, which will then be skipped during ingestion (preferable to invalid or all-zero user IDs).</li><li>Fix any invalid user IDs in your system before ingesting the data.</li></ul> |
