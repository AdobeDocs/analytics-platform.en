Once you have [created or edited one or more connections](/help/connections/create-connection.md), you can manage them in **[!UICONTROL Connections]**. The [!UICONTROL Connections] interface let you:

* View all your connections at a glance, including the owner, the sandbox, and when the connections were created and modified.
* Edit a connection.
* Delete a connection.
* Create a data view from a connection.
* View all datasets in a connection.
* Check the status of your connection's datasets and the status of the ingestion process. For example, when is your data available so that you can start with reporting and analysis in Analysis Workspace.
* Identify any data discrepancies due to misconfiguration. Are you missing any rows? If so, what rows are missing and why? Did you misconfigure connections and cause missing data in Customer Journey Analytics?
* Get insights on the usage of ingested and reportable rows across all your connections.

[!UICONTROL Connections] has two interfaces: [[!UICONTROL List]](#list) and [[!UICONTROL Usage]](#usage).


## List

The **[!UICONTROL List]** interface is the default interface for Connections. If not selected, select the **[!UICONTROL List]** tab to access the interface.

* Identify configuration problems that can cause skipped or deleted records.
* See when the data is available for reporting.

| User Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Edit](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Edit_18_N.svg) **[!UICONTROL Edit Connection]** | To edit the details of a connection, select ![Edit](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Edit_18_N.svg) **[!UICONTROL Edit Connection]**. See [Create or edit a connection](create-connection.md) for more information. |
| **[!UICONTROL *Dataset selector*]** | Select one or all datasets to show details for in the connection. You cannot multi-select datasets. Defaults to **[!UICONTROL All datasets]**. |
| **[!UICONTROL *Date range selector*]** | Select a data range to show details for in the connection. Edit start date, end date, or select ![Calendar](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Calendar_18_N.svg) to open the date range selector. In the date range selector, select a date range by using one of the predefined periods (for example **[!UICONTROL Last 6 months]**) or use the calendar to select start and end date. Select **[!UICONTROL Apply]** to apply the new date range to the connection details.|
| **[!UICONTROL Records of event data available]** | The total number of event dataset rows available for reporting, **for the entire connection**. This count is independent of any date range or dataset selection. |
| [!UICONTROL **[!UICONTROL Metrics]**] | Summarize the event, lookup, profile and summary dataset records that are added, skipped, and deleted, and the number of batches added. These metrics are based on **the dataset and date range that you have selected**.<p>Select **[!UICONTROL Check detail]** to show the **[!UICONTROL Check skipped detail]** popup. The popup lists the number of skipped records and the reason for all event datasets or selected dataset.<p>![Skipped records](assets/skipped-records.png)<p>Select ![Info](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_InfoOutline_18_N.svg) popup with more information. For some skipped reasons, like [!UICONTROL Empty visitor ID], the popup displays **[!UICONTROL Sample PSQL for EQS]** (Experience Platform for Query Service) you can use in [Query Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/home) to query for the skipped records in the dataset. Select ![Copy](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Copy_18_N.svg) **[!UICONTROL Copy sample PSQL for EQS]** to copy the SQL. |
| **[!UICONTROL Records added]** | A visualization to indicate how many rows were added in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Updates every 10 minutes. |
| **[!UICONTROL Records skipped]** | A visualization to indicate how many rows were skipped in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Reasons for skipping records include: missing timestamps, missing or invalid Person ID or Account ID [!BADGE B2B Edition]{type=Informative url="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-b2b/cja-b2b-edition" newtab=true tooltip="Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition"}, and so forth. Updates every 10 minutes. <p>Invalid IDs (such as `undefined`, or `00000000`, or any combination of numbers and letters in a [!UICONTROL Person ID] that appear in an event more than 1 million times in a given month) are IDs that cannot be attributed to any specific user or person. These rows cannot be ingested into the system and result in error-prone ingestion and reporting. To fix invalid Person IDs or Account IDs [!BADGE B2B Edition]{type=Informative url="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-b2b/cja-b2b-edition" newtab=true tooltip="Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition"}, you have 3 options:<ul><li>Use [Stitching](/help/stitching/overview.md) to populate the undefined or all-zero user IDs with valid user IDs.</li><li>Blank out user IDs, which are then skipped during ingestion (preferable to invalid or all-zero user IDs).</li><li>Fix any invalid user IDs in your system before ingesting the data.</li></ul> |
| **[!UICONTROL Records deleted]** | A visualization to indicate how many rows were deleted in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Someone might have deleted a dataset in [!DNL Experience Platform], for example. Updates every 10 minutes.<p>In some scenarios, this value can also include records replaced, as with stitching or some lookup dataset updates. Consider this example:</p><ul><li>You upload one record to an XDM Individual Profile dataset, which Customer Journey Analytics is configured to ingest as profile lookup data. In the connection details, this dataset would display 1 record added.</li><li>You upload a duplicate of the original record into the same AEP dataset, which now contains two records. Customer Journey Analytics ingests the additional record from the profile or account [!BADGE B2B Edition]{type=Informative url="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-b2b/cja-b2b-edition" newtab=true tooltip="Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition"} lookup dataset. Seeing that a profile or account record is already ingested in the connection for that Person ID or Account ID [!BADGE B2B Edition]{type=Informative url="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-b2b/cja-b2b-edition" newtab=true tooltip="Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition"}, Customer Journey Analytics deletes its earlier version and adds the new profile data. In the connection details, this action would represent 1 record added and 1 record deleted, because Customer Journey Analytics only retains the most recent profile lookup data for any ingested Person ID or Account ID [!BADGE B2B Edition]{type=Informative url="https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-overview/cja-b2b/cja-b2b-edition" newtab=true tooltip="Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition"}.</li><li>In total, the AEP dataset contains two records that happen to be identical. Separately, the Customer Journey Analytics connection details display the status of its ingested data: 2 records added and 1 record deleted for this profile dataset. </li></ul> |
| ![Search](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Search_18_N.svg) | Dataset search field. You can search the datasets table by dataset name or dataset ID. |
| [!UICONTROL Datasets table ] | The datasets that are part of the connection. See the table below for further explanation. Select ![SelectBox](/help/assets/icons/SelectBox.svg) a single dataset to show only connection details for the selected dataset.

The [!UICONTROL Usage] interface shows the usage of ingested and reportable rows across all connections. If not selected, select the **[!UICONTROL Usage]** tab to access the interface.

This interface supports you to determine whether your Customer Journey Analytics usage complies with what is contractually agreed upon. In addition to monitoring purposes, you can use the Usage interface to plan your Customer Journey Analytics license renewal.

The Usage interface uses the following metrics:

| Metric name | Description |
|---|---|
| **Historical reportable rows** | Count of rows for the period older than 13 months. |
| **Core reportable rows** | Count of rows over the last 13 months. | 
| **Core data volume** | Total amount of data stored on disk. |
| **Average row size** | Average amount of storage consumed for each row of data ingested and stored. |
| **Ingested rows** | How many rows are ingested for the specific period. |
| **Reportable rows** | How many rows of data do you have as part of the connection for the specific period. |
| **Cumulative rows** | How many rows are ingested up until the specific month. |

>[!NOTE]
>
>Data is collected, starting from July 2024 for the core, historical, and total records. Reach out to your account manager for earlier historical data.
>

The Usage interface consists of two panels:

* The **[!UICONTROL Key usage metrics]** panel that displays:
  
  * Four summary visualizations that display total and percentual changes from the previous month for:

    * **[!UICONTROL Core data reportable rows]**. The total number of rows available over the past 13 months for the current month, with a percentage change compared to the previous month. For example, on February 1, 2024, the number shows the total rows available with an event timestamp from January 2023 to January 2024.
    * **[!UICONTROL Historical data reportable rows]**. The total number of rows available over a period older than 13 months for the current month, with a percentage change compared to the previous month. For example, on February 1, 2024, the number shows the total rows available with an event timestamp older than January 2023.
    * **[!UICONTROL Core data volume]**. The total amount of data stored on disk that is timestamped for the current month (in TB), with a percentage change compared to the previous month.
    * **[!UICONTROL Average row size]**. The average amount of storage consumed by each row of data ingested and stored for the current month (in kB), with a percentage change compared to the previous month.
  
  * A stacked vertical bar visualization that displays the **[!UICONTROL Core and Historical data reportable rows]** for the last 13 months. 
  
    When you hover over any stacked bar in the visualization, a popup shows the number of rows for that specific part of the bar. In the example below, the core data reportable rows are shown for the current month (August 2025: 936M (936,347,325)).


    ![Key Usage Metrics](assets/usage-key-usage-metrics.png)

* A combined panel, showing three subpanels for:

  +++ Ingested rows

  The **[!UICONTROL Ingested rows]** subpanel measures the total number of records added to the system each month, providing insight into data growth and ingestion rates. The subpanel provides a summary of this month's total ingested rows and the change from the previous month.

  ![Ingested rows](assets/usage-ingested-rows.png)

  You can hover over data points in the visualization to display a popup with more details.

  +++

  +++ Reportable rows

  The **[!UICONTROL Reportable rows]** visualization tracks the number of rows available for reporting by subtracting skipped and deleted rows from ingested rows, serving as a key metric for billing and data usage. The subpanel provides two summaries:
  
  * **[!UICONTROL Last month total]**: A summary of total reportable rows up until this month.
  * **[!UICONTROL This month]**: A summary of this month's total reportable rows and the change from the previous month.

  ![Reportable rows](assets/usage-reportable-rows.png)

  You can hover over data points in the visualizations to display a popup with more details.

  +++

  +++ Detail breakdown

  You can use the **[!UICONTROL Detail breakdown]** table to view detailed metrics by connection, dataset, sandbox, and tags. Datasets are reported using ids instead of names, as dataset names can be modified during a reporting period. Unknown datasets or connections are reported using ids.

  For the months before September 2024, data was collected at the dataset level and is displayed as [!UICONTROL Other datasets] for clarity. Starting from September 2024, data is gathered at a granular dataset level, and [!UICONTROL Other datasets] do no longer appear.

  * To change the breakdown, select a combination for **[!UICONTROL View by]** and **[!UICONTROL Breakdown by]**.

    | **[!UICONTROL View by]** options | **[!UICONTROL Breakdown by]** options |
    |---|---|
    | **[!UICONTROL Connection]** | **[!UICONTROL -]** and **[!UICONTROL Dataset]** |
    | **[!UICONTROL Dataset]** | **[!UICONTROL -]** |
    | **[!UICONTROL Sandbox]** | **[!UICONTROL Connection]** | 
    | **[!UICONTROL Tag]** | **[!UICONTROL Connection]** | 

  ![Detail breakdown](assets/usage-detail-breakdown.png)

  You can define a **[!UICONTROL Time range]** in months to report on. Use ![Calendar](/help/assets/icons/Calendar.svg) to select the time range.
