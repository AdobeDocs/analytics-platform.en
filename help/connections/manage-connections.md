# Manage connections

Once you have [created or edited one or more connections](/help/connections/create-connection.md), you can manage them in **[!UICONTROL Connections]**. Connections let you:

* View all your connections at a glance, including the owner, the sandbox, and when the connections were created and modified.
* Edit a connection.
* Delete a connection.
* Create a data view from a connection.
* View all datasets in a connection.
* Check the status of your connection's datasets and the status of the ingestion process. For example, when is your data available so that you can start with reporting and analysis in Analysis Workspace.
* Identify any data discrepancies due to misconfiguration. Are you missing any rows? If so, what rows are missing and why? Did you misconfigure connections and cause missing data in Customer Journey Analytics?
* Get insights on the usage of ingested and reportable rows across all your connections.

[!UICONTROL Connections] has two interfaces: [[!UICONTROL List]](#list) and [[!UICONTROL Usage]](#usage).


## List

The [!UICONTROL List] interface is the default interface for Connections. If not selected, select the **[!UICONTROL List]** tab to access the interface.

| User Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Edit](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Edit_18_N.svg) [!UICONTROL Edit Connection] | To edit the details of a connection, select ![Edit](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Edit_18_N.svg) **[!UICONTROL Edit Connection]**. See [Create or edit a connection](create-connection.md) for more information. |
| Dataset selector | Lets you pick one or all datasets in the connection. You cannot multi-select datasets. Defaults to [!UICONTROL All datasets]. |
| Date range selector | Edit start date, end date, or select ![Calendar](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Calendar_18_N.svg) to open the date range selector. In the date range selector, select a date range by using one of the predefined periods (for example **[!UICONTROL Last 6 months]**) or use the calendar to select start and end date. Select **[!UICONTROL Apply]** to apply the new date range.|
| [!UICONTROL Records of event data available] | The total number of event dataset rows available for reporting, **for the entire connection**. This count is independent of any calendar settings. The count changes if you select a dataset from the dataset selector or by selecting a dataset in the table. Once data is added, there is a latency of 1-2 hours to get the data to appear in reporting. |
| [!UICONTROL Metrics] | Summarize the event, lookup, profile and summary dataset records that are added, skipped, and deleted, and the number of batches added. These metrics are based on **the dataset and date range you have selected**.<p>Select **[!UICONTROL Check detail]** to show the **[!UICONTROL Check skipped detail]** popup. The popup lists the number of skipped records and the reason for all event datasets or selected dataset.<p><img src="./assets/skipped-records.png" width="500"/><p>Select ![Info](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_InfoOutline_18_N.svg) popup with more information. For some skipped reasons, like [!UICONTROL Empty visitor ID], the popup displays Sample PSQL for EQS (Experience Platform for Query Service) you can use in [Query Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/query/home) to query for the skipped records in the dataset. Select ![Copy](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Copy_18_N.svg) **[!UICONTROL Copy sample PSQL for EQS]** to copy the SQL. |
| [!UICONTROL Records added] | Indicates how many rows were added in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Updated every 10 minutes. |
| [!UICONTROL Records skipped] | Indicates how many rows were skipped in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Reasons for skipping records include: missing timestamps, missing or invalid person ID, and so forth. Updated every 10 minutes. <p>Invalid person IDs (such as `undefined`, or `00000000`, or any combination of numbers and letters in a [!UICONTROL Person ID] that appears in an event more than 1 million times in a given month) are IDs that cannot be attributed to any specific user or person. These rows cannot be ingested into the system and result in error-prone ingestion and reporting. To fix invalid person IDs, you have 3 options:<ul><li>Use [Stitching](/help/stitching/overview.md) to populate the undefined or all-zero user IDs with valid user IDs.</li><li>Blank out the user ID, which are then kipped during ingestion (preferable to invalid or all-zero user IDs).</li><li>Fix any invalid user IDs in your system before ingesting the data.</li></ul> |
| [!UICONTROL Records] deleted | Indicates how many rows were deleted in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Someone might have deleted a dataset in [!DNL Experience Platform], for example. Updated every 10 minutes.<p>In some scenarios, this value can also include records replaced, as with stitching or some lookup dataset updates. Consider this example:</p><ul><li>You upload one record to an XDM Individual Profile dataset, which Customer Journey Analytics is configured to ingest as profile lookup data. In the connection details, this dataset would display 1 record added.</li><li>You upload a duplicate of the original record into the same AEP dataset, which now contains two records. Customer Journey Analytics ingests the additional record from the profile lookup dataset. Seeing that it has already ingested a profile record in the connection for that person ID, Customer Journey Analytics deletes its earlier version and adds the new profile data. In the connection details, this action would represent 1 record added and 1 record deleted, because Customer Journey Analytics only retains the most recent profile lookup data for any ingested person ID.</li><li>In total, the AEP dataset contains two records that happen to be identical. Separately, the Customer Journey Analytics connection details display the status of its ingested data: 2 records added and 1 record deleted for this profile dataset. </li></ul> |
| ![Search](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Search_18_N.svg) _Search dataset name or ID_ | Dataset search field. You can search the datasets table by dataset name or [!UICONTROL Dataset ID]. |

## Usage

The [!UICONTROL Usage] interface shows the usage of ingested and reportable rows across all connections. This interface supports you to determine whether your Customer Journey Analytics usage complies with what is contractually agreed upon. In addition to monitoring purposes, you can use the Usage UI to plan your Customer Journey Analytics license renewal.

You can select a time range (between last 6 months, year to date, or last 2 Years) and an interval (between monthly or quarterly) to monitor Customer Journey Analytics usage. The interface is divided into two sections:

* Ingested rows: total rows ingested/sent from event datasets across all Customer Journey Analytics Connections, including records skipped during ingestion
* Reportable rows: total reportable rows that include all events data across all Customer Journey Analytics Connections

![usage-view](assets/usage-view.png)

Select the **[!UICONTROL Usage]** tab to access the interface.

### Report on usage

1. Select a **[!UICONTROL Time range]**. You can select between **[!UICONTROL Last 6 months]**, **[!UICONTROL Year to date]**, or **[!UICONTROL Last 2 Years]**.
1. Select an **[!UICONTROL Interval]**. You can select between **[!UICONTROL Monthly]** or **[!UICONTROL Quarterly]**.

For [!UICONTROL Ingested rows]:

* A panel displays the total ingested rows that include all the events data across all the connections updated on every 2nd day of a month. Within the panel: 
  * a box displays the number of ingested rows for the last month and the change in % (indicated by ▲ or ▼) from the previous month.
  * a line graph displays the ◼︎ [!UICONTROL Monthly ingested rows].<br/>To see a popup that displays the number of monthly ingested rows for a month, hover over any data point in the line graph.
