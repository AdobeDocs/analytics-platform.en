# Manage connections

Once Admin users have [created one or more connections](/help/connections/create-connection.md), they can manage them in the [!UICONTROL Connections] Manager. The latest update to the Connection experience adds two important capabilities within the Connection Details page, described further down on this page:

* It lets you check the **status of your connection's datasets and of the ingestion process**. This status check lets you know when your data is available so that you can go into Analysis Workspace and start analysis.

* It lets you **identify any data discrepancies** due to misconfiguration. Are you missing any rows? If yes, what rows are missing and why? Did you misconfigure connections and cause missing data in Customer Journey Analytics?

Here is a video about the new Connections Manager:

## Connections Manager {#connections-manager}

The Connections Manager allows you to:

* View all your connections at a glance, including the owner, the sandbox, and when they were created and modified.
* View all datasets in a connection.
* Check the status of a connection.
* Delete a connection.
* Rename a connection.
* Create a data view from a connection.

### Connection Manager settings

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL Name] | The connection's friendly name. When you click the hyperlinked name, you get to the Connection details page described below.|
| Connection info | Click the info icon next to the connection name to view the following information:![View connection info](assets/conn-info.png) |
| Edit a connection | Click the ellipsis (...) next to the connection name, then click [!UICONTROL Edit].![Edit connection](assets/conn-edit-delete.png) For more information, see "Edit connection" below. |
| Delete a connection | Click the ellipsis (...) next to the connection name, then click [!UICONTROL Delete]. More information under the "Delete connections" heading below.|
| Create data view | Click the ellipsis (...) next to the connection name, then click [!UICONTROL Create data view]. This action creates a new data view based on this connection. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/data-views.html) |
| [!UICONTROL Datasets] | The datasets that are part of the connection. You can click the hyperlink to view all the datasets in the connection. Clicking on a dataset opens that dataset in Adobe Experience Platform, in a new tab. |
| [!UICONTROL Sandbox] | The [Adobe Experience Platform sandbox](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sandbox/home.html) from which this connection draws its datasets. This sandbox was selected when you first created the connection. It cannot be changed.|
| [!UICONTROL Owner] | The person who created the connection. |
| [!UICONTROL Import Data Sets] | Lets you enable or disable what used to be called "data streaming." |
| [!UICONTROL Date Created] | The date when the connection was first created. |
| [!UICONTROL Last Modified] | The date when the connection was last updated. |

### Delete connections {#connections-delete}

Only Admins have permission to delete a connection. This action does not show up for non-admins.

1. Click the ellipsis (...) next to the connection name.
1. Click [!UICONTROL Delete].

When you delete a connection in [!UICONTROL Customer Journey Analytics], an error message will indicate that:

* Any data views that were created based on the deleted connection no longer work.
* Similarly, any Workspace projects that depend on data views in the deleted connection will cease working.

[Learn more](/help/admin/cja-deletion.md) about deletion implications.
 
### Search for a connection or dataset

You can search for connections using the Search bar at the top, underneath the [!UICONTROL Connections] title.

### Sort connections

You can sort connections by clicking each column header and sorting up or down.

## Connection Details page {#connection-detail}

The new Connections Details page gives you a very detailed view of the status of a connection.

It lets you:

* Check the status of your connection's datasets and of the ingestion process.
* Identify configuration problems that lead to skipped, or deleted records.
* See when the data is available for reporting.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Any data ingested before August 13, 2021, is not reflected in this [!UICONTROL Connections] dialog.

 Here are the widgets and settings explained:

![All datasets window showing the widgets and settings](assets/conn-details.png)

### Connection Details settings

| Widget/Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dataset selector | Lets you pick one or all datasets in the connection. You cannot multi-select datasets. Defaults to [!UICONTROL All datasets]. |
| Calendar/Date Ranges | The date range indicates when you added data to the connection. All standard calendar presets are included. You can customize the date range, but no custom date ranges show up in the drop-down list. |
| [!UICONTROL Records of event data available] widget | Represents the total number of event dataset rows available for reporting, **for the entire connection**. This count is independent of any calendar settings. It changes if you select a dataset from the dataset selector or by selecting a dataset in the table. (Note that there is a latency of 1-2 hours to get the data to appear in reporting, once it is added.) |
| [!UICONTROL Metrics] widget | Summarizes the event records added/skipped/deleted, and the number of batches added, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. |
| [!UICONTROL Records added] widget | Indicates how many rows were added in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Updated every 10 minutes. <p>**Note**: Data for **[!UICONTROL Records added]** includes only event data at this time, not profile or lookup data. |
| [!UICONTROL Records skipped] widget | Indicates how many rows were skipped in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Reasons for skipping records include: Missing timestamps, missing or invalid person ID, etc. Updated every 10 minutes.<p>Invalid person IDs (such as "undefined", or "00000000", or any combination of numbers and letters in a [!UICONTROL Person ID] that appears in an event more than 1 million times in a given month) cannot be attributed to any specific user or person. They cannot be ingested into the system and result in error-prone ingestion and reporting. To fix invalid person IDs, you have 3 options:<ul><li>Use [Cross-Channel Analysis](/help/stitching/overview.md) to populate the undefined or all-zero user IDs with valid user IDs.</li><li>Blank out the user ID, which will them also be skipped during ingestion (preferable to invalid or all-zero user IDs).</li><li>Fix any invalid user IDs in your system before ingesting the data.</li></ul><p>**Note**: Data for **[!UICONTROL Records skipped]** includes only event data at this time, not profile or lookup data. |
| [!UICONTROL Records deleted] widget | Indicates how many rows were deleted in the selected time period, **for the dataset and date range you have selected**. Someone might have deleted a dataset in Experience Platform, for example. Updated every 10 minutes. <p>**Note**: Data for **[!UICONTROL Records deleted]** includes only event data at this time, not profile or lookup data. |
| Dataset search box | You can search by dataset name or [!UICONTROL Dataset ID]. |
| [!UICONTROL Datasets] | Shows the datasets that are part of the connection. You can click the hyperlink to view all the datasets in the connection.  |
| [!UICONTROL Dataset ID] |  This ID is automatically generated by Adobe Experience Platform. |
| [!UICONTROL Batches] | Indicates how many data batches have been added to this dataset. |
| [!UICONTROL Last added] | Shows the timestamp for the last added batch to this dataset.  |
| [!UICONTROL Dataset type] | The dataset type for this dataset can be [!UICONTROL Event], [!UICONTROL Lookup], or [!UICONTROL Profile]. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-connections/create-connection.html#configure-dataset)  |

They cannot be ingested into the system and result in error-prone ingestion and reporting. To fix invalid person IDs, you have 3 options:<ul><li>Use [Stitching](/help/stitching/overview.md) to populate the undefined or all-zero user IDs with valid user IDs.</li><li>Blank out the user ID, which will them also be skipped during ingestion (preferable to invalid or all-zero user IDs).</li><li>Fix any invalid user IDs in your system before ingesting the data.</li></ul><p>**Note**: Data for **[!UICONTROL Records skipped]** includes only event data at this time, not profile or lookup data. |
