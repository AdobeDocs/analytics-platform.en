>Audience analysis is different from audience publishing, which allows you to create and publish audiences discovered in Customer Journey Analytics to Adobe Experience Platform for customer targeting and personalization. For information about audience publishing,  see [Audience publishing overview](/help/components/audiences/audiences-overview.md).


Audience analysis allows you to ingest audience membership data from Experience Platform Profile datasets into a Customer Journey Analytics connection. Audiences become available as new dimensions for use in Analysis Workspace.

With audience data available in Customer Journey Analytics, you can gain actionable insights into how audience members behave across various channels. 

For example, you can track the behavior of individual customers who were included in the same email promotion. With the audience available in Customer Journey Analytics, you can see the following kinds of information about each audience member:

* Click-throughs from the email to the site that eventually resulted in a purchase

* Audience members who eventually made an in-store purchase
