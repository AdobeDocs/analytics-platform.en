# Connections overview

Connections allow Customer Journey Analytics product administrators to establish connections with different [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] data sources, such as event, lookup, and profile datasets. These connections enable the integration of data from a Connection to a derivative Data View. Connections are the foundation of CJA and are created from [!DNL Experience Platform] source datasets. Access to Connections also lets you view the Connections manager, where you can view the underlying datasets that make up the connection, as well as make critical editing and configuration selections.

We recommended restricting access to Connections management to a core management group. Configurations at the Connection level have contractual implications regarding volume allotments for data brought into Customer Journey Analytics.
