6. In the **[!UICONTROL Ask about Customer Journey Analytics]** dialog at the bottom of the page, ask a data visualization question using Data Insights Agent.
 
   For more information, see the following examples.

### Example 1

For example, let's say you are interested in the orders your business received in July. 

**Prompt:** Enter *"Trend orders in July."*

   ![AI prompt](/help/assets/ai-asst-prompt1.png)

**Response:** Data Insights Agent gathers insights by looking through the data in the data view, including the metrics and components. It translates the prompt into the right dimensions and metrics within the data range.

   As you can see, it automatically generated a line graph and a freeform table to show orders for July.

   ![Answer to prompt - line graph and freeform table](/help/assets/ai-asst-result.png)

### Example 2

Next, you want to see how your revenue compares by region.

**Prompt:** In the prompt window, enter *"Show revenue by region."*

**Response:** Data Insights Agent intelligently understands that by "region," you mean "customer region." It produces a bar chart that best shows revenue by region:

   ![Bar chart](/help/assets/ai-asst-result2.png)
   
### Example 3

Next, in addition to understanding revenue by region, you also want to see data for profit by region. Instead of repeating the previous prompt, you can ask Data Insights Agent to update the most recent visualization and freeform table. 

**Prompt:** In the prompt window, type *"Add profit."*

**Response:** The **[!UICONTROL Bar]** chart still provides the most concise answer, but the profit metric has been added as a column in the freeform table:

   ![Bar chart](/help/assets/ai-asst-result4.png)

### Example 4

Finally, let's look at the revenue by product category.

**Prompt:** In the prompt window, enter *"Proportion of revenue by product category."*

**Response:** Again, Data Insights Agent picks the most appropriate visualization, in this case the **[!UICONTROL Donut]** visualization, to answer the question.

   ![Donut](/help/assets/ai-asst-result3.png)

## Example data visualization prompts

The following are some examples of common prompts and the visualizations used by Data Insights Agent to respond to those prompts.

| Example prompt | Expected visualization |
| --- | --- |
| Show me profits in [Month] | Line<p>Asking for a trend or metric within a certain time range by default returns a line visualization. |
| Trend orders in [Month] | Line |
| Show revenue by region in [Month] | Bar |
| Share of revenue by product category | Donut |
| Orders by day of week, from January to May | Bar |
| Show orders by gender, from March to June | Bar |
| What is the profit across SKUs from February to May | Bar |
| Revenue by store name in [Month] | Bar |
| What were my top 10 SKUs by profit in [Month]? | Bar |
| Proportion of purchases by month of year | Donut |
| Total profit in [Month] | Summary Number<p>Asking for the "total" of a metric across a certain time range should return a Summary number visualization. |


## Prompting best practices

Data Insights Agent processes the context provided by each user prompt and tries to respond intelligently with the most appropriate visualization and components in a freeform table. 

Responses can vary based on the specific words and phrases used in the prompt, and slight changes in language can lead to different results. 

To achieve the best results, consider the following guidelines: 

* **Be specific:** Include exact terms to narrow down the response. The following is an example of a specific prompt: "Last month's sales in California"

* **Use clear metrics, dimensions, and segments:** Adding specific metrics (such as "Revenue"), dimensions (such as "website name"), segments (such as "iPhone users"), and date ranges (such as "last three months") helps Data Insights Agent focus on the right data.

* **Ask direct questions:** Phrasing questions directly makes it easier for Data Insights Agent to provide clear, relevant insights. The following is an example of asking a direct question in a prompt: "What is the average revenue by product category this year?" 

Review the following table of example terms and phrases that you can use in prompts with Data Insights Agent, along with the types of responses you can expect. 

These examples are designed to help you get familiar with how specific words or structures can influence Data Insight Agent's output, ensuring more precise and valuable insights. Data Insights Agent uses generative AI, so visualizations or selected data may vary slightly across similar prompts.
  
| Desired outcome | Example terms and phrases |
| --- | --- |
| Summary number visualization | <ul><li>Total</li></ul> |
| Compare components | <ul><li>Compare</li><li>VS</li><li>Contrast</li><li>Week-to-Week</li><li>Month-over-Month</li><li>Quarter-over-Quarter</li><li>Year-over-Year</li></ul> |
| Donut visualization | <ul><li>Proportion</li><li>Share of</li><li>Distribution</li><li>Percentage</li><li>Contribution</li><li>Portion</li><li>Parts</li></ul> |
| Line visualization | <ul><li>Trend</li><li>[Metric] in [Time range]</li></ul> |
| Bar visualization | <ul><li>[Metric] by [Dimension]</li></ul> |

## Beta testing expectations and requested feedback

After posing each question, carefully review the assistant's provided answer. It's crucial to evaluate the generated visualizations comprehensively before providing feedback. 

Consider the following when evaluating a response from Data Insights Agent: 

* Chat rail response or template: Evaluate the textual response provided. Is the response appropriate given the context of your prompt? 

* Visualization/chart: Evaluate the visualization. Is it the appropriate or expected visualization for your question, or would you have expected a different visualization?  

* Freeform table: Evaluate the freeform table. Is the freeform table data correct? Is it breaking down data where requested? Are the applied segments those that you requested or expected? 

* Error Message / Out-of-Scope: If a generic error message is given stating the question is out of scope, provide feedback on whether you think the out-of-scope message is appropriate, given your prompt. Was your prompt actually in scope? 

**For every response, give a thumbs up or thumbs down, based on the response.**

Following the thumbs up or thumbs down selection, please make a selection for the relevant multi-select feedback boxes. If you want to provide additional feedback, add notes in the open text box.

## Configuration best practices

Below are best practices for your Customer Journey Analytics configuration (data view, calculated metrics, segments, and more) to ensure that the Data Insights Agent can locate the correct components and return cleaner answers without having to prompt you for additional information.

* **Balance what components you need**. Do not add all the fields of your datasets as metrics or dimension components to your data view. Especially, those you most certainly will not use in your analysis. On the other hand, do not strictly limit yourself only to the fields you anticipate you require for your analysis. A too limited data view restricts the flexibility in your analysis and the Data Insights Agent functionality.
* **Always use friendly display names**. Ensure that all fields you define in your data view, either as a metric or dimension component, have a friendly component name. The process of renaming fields with a friendly name is especially relevant for fields from Adobe Analytics source connector datasets. These fields often have non-friendly unidentifiable names, like `eVar41` or `prop25`.
* **Use distinctive names**. Distinctive names are especially relevant when you use the same field as both a metric and a dimension component in your data view. Or when you use a field in multiple components of the same type (such as in two different metrics), each with different component settings. 
* **Use a component naming convention**. You can use a component naming convention to group components. For example, **[!UICONTROL Orders | Product]** and  **[!UICONTROL Orders | Customer]** can distinguish between different order metrics that might exist in your data.
* **Use the Data Dictionary**. Add description and other relevant data for components in the Data Dictionary. The Data Insight Agent currently does not use description and tags from the Data Dictionary, but it might in the future. 
* **Use approved calculated metrics**. Agree on a process to use only approved calculated metrics as components in your data view, and avoid using experimental calculated metrics.
* **Share required segments**. Ensure that you share segments and make segments visible that are required for Data Insights Agent prompts.
* **Standardize on component names across data views**. If you use the same fields as a component in multiple data views, ensure that you use a single friendly name and a single identifier for that component. A single name and identifier allows the Data Insights Agent to switch data views without losing context.
