# Experience Platform Data Mirror overview

The Experience Platform Data Mirror feature provides a seamless integration of data warehouse native solutions (like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, and Databricks). The functionality supports deletions, upserts, and appends at low latency.


>[!NOTE]
>
>The Experience Platform Data Mirror feature for Customer Journey Analytics is available in a public beta until March 25, 2026. During the beta period, Change Data Capture (CDC) updates are limited to 0.5% of your organization's rows of data entitlement for Customer Journey Analytics, applied monthly (for example, 0.5% of the rows of data entitlement divided by 12, each month). Adobe reserves the right to terminate beta access to the Experience Platform Data Mirror feature should your organization exceed this limit.
