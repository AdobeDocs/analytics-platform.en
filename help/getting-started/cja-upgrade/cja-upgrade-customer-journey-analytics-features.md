The following list shows only those Customer Journey Analytics features that require consideration during the upgrade process. For a comprehensive list that shows which Adobe Analytics features are fully supported, partially supported, or not supported in Customer Journey Analytics, see [Customer Journey Analytics feature support](/help/getting-started/aa-vs-cja/cja-aa.md).

Consider which of the following Customer Journey Analytics features you want to adopt when you upgrade to Customer Journey Analytics:

| Customer Journey Analytics feature | Function | 
|---------|----------|
| [Tie web data with data from other channels, such as call center data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-usecases/cross-channel/cross-channel) | Customer Journey Analytics is combined with Experience Platform's ability to hold all kinds of data schemas and types. Using [Experience Data Model (XDM)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html), data can be uniformly represented and organized, ready for combination and exploration. Adobe Analytics is predominantly focused on web and mobile analytics data with some capabilities to [import data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/import/home.html). | 
| [Stitch hits from other datasets using a custom dimension](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/stitching/overview) | Customer Journey Analytics allows you to [combine data](/help/connections/combined-dataset.md) from multiple report suites as if they were a single report suite in Adobe Analytics. | 
| [Integrate with Adobe Real-time CDP](/help/components/audiences/audiences-overview.md) | You can [create and publish audiences](/help/components/audiences/audiences-overview.md) discovered in Customer Journey Analytics to Real-Time Customer Profile in Adobe Experience Platform for customer targeting and personalization. | 
| [Integrate with Adobe Target (A4T)](/help/integrations/at.md) | Target Reporting in Customer Journey Analytics enables you to [measure and report on Adobe Target activities](/help/integrations/at.md) directly in Customer Journey Analytics. However, Adobe recommends integrating with Adobe Journey Optimizer for personalization use cases.  | 
| [Integrate with Adobe Journey Optimizer](/help/integrations/ajo.md) | You can configure data generated by Journey Optimizer to [perform advanced analysis in Customer Journey Analytics](/help/integrations/ajo.md).  | 
| [Integrate with Adobe Audience Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/implementation-integration-guides/integration-experience-platform/aam-aep-audience-sharing) | You can [share Audience Manager traits and segments to Adobe Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/implementation-integration-guides/integration-experience-platform/aam-aep-audience-sharing). However, Adobe recommends integrating with Adobe Real-time CDP for audience-based use cases.  |
