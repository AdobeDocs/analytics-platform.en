Choose one of the following options to retain historical data when moving from Adobe Analytics to Customer Journey Analytics:  

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>When choosing how to retain historical data, contact your Adobe account representative to determine pricing. 

## Use the Analytics Source Connector

  You can use the [Analytics Source Connector](/help/data-ingestion/analytics.md) to retain historical data. Regardless of the upgrade path that you choose (even if you upgrade using the Web SDK), you can use the Analytics Source Connector to retain historical data from your Adobe Analytics environment. 

  You can use the Analytics Source Connector to retain historical data by bringing historical data into its own dedicated location, separate from your current data.

  The Analytics Source Connector must be functioning for as long as you need access to the historical data.

  <!-- Another possibility in the future: Map historical data in a way that allows you to tie it to your new data.  Possible? Explain -->

## Maintain your existing Adobe Analytics implementation

You can maintain your existing Adobe Analytics implementation alongside your new Customer Journey Analytics implementation for a specific time frame (for example, 1 year). When choosing this option, consider the following:

* Data would not be available in Experience Platform.

* You should plan to decommission the Adobe Analytics implementation after you have sufficient data in Customer Journey Analytics. 

## Next, perform additional implementation tasks

At this point in the upgrade process, you need to perform various implementation tasks before your Customer Journey Analytics environment is ready to use.

These additional tasks apply to upgrades from Adobe Analytics as well as new Customer Journey Analytics implementations.

These tasks include:

* Bringing other data into Experience Platform

* Creating connections between Platform datasets and Customer Journey Analytics

* Creating data views

* Porting the reporting API usage

* Accounting for Data Feeds and Data Warehouse use cases

* Migrating projects and components

* Planning user onboarding
