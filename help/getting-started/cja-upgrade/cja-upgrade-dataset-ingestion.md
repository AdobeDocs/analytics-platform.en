<!-- Should we single source this instead of duplicate it? The following steps were copied from: /help/data-ingestion/aepwebsdk.md-->

After you configure your Web SDK implementation, you need to check the statuses of individual batches to verify that data is being ingested into the dataset.

1. In the Experience Platform UI, select **[!UICONTROL Monitoring]** in the left-navigation.

   The Monitoring dashboard displays. This dashboard lets you view the statuses of inbound data from either batch or streaming ingestion.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Batch end-to-end]** to view a list of batches. 

   If no batches are displayed, check your Web SDK implementation to ensure that it is correctly sending data to Adobe.

1. Select the batch ID for a given dataset, then validate that **[!UICONTROL Success]** is shown in the **[!UICONTROL Status]** field.

   If **[!UICONTROL Failed]** is shown in the **[!UICONTROL Status]** field, check your Web SDK implementation to ensure that it is correctly sending data to Adobe.

   Repeat this step to verify the status of each batch.
