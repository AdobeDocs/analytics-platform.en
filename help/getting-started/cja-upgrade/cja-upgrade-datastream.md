A datastream represents the server-side configuration when implementing the Adobe Experience Platform Web and Mobile SDKs. When collecting data with the Adobe Experience Platform SDKs, data is sent to the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network. It is the datastream that determines to which services that data is forwarded.

In your setup, you want to configure the datastream to send the collected data to your dataset in Adobe Experience Platform.

To set up your datastream:

1. In Adobe Experience Platform, select **[!UICONTROL Datastreams]** from [!UICONTROL DATA COLLECTION] in the left rail.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL New Datastream]**.

1. Name and describe your datastream. Select your schema from the [!UICONTROL Event Schema] list.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

1. Continue following the [recommended upgrade steps](/help/getting-started/cja-upgrade/cja-upgrade-recommendations.md#recommended-upgrade-steps-for-most-organizations) or the [dynamically generated upgrade steps](https://gigazelle.github.io/cja-ttv/).
