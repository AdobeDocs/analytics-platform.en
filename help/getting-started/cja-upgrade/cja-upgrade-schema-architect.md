Adobe recommends creating an Experience Data Model (XDM) schema when upgrading to Customer Journey Analytics. An XDM schema allows for a streamlined schema that is tailored to the needs of your organization and the specific Platform applications that you use. When changes to the schema are required, you don't have to sift through thousands of unused fields to find the field that requires updating.  

Review the following sections as you begin architecting your XDM schema.

## Avoid Adobe Analytics restrictions in your XDM schema

The underlying architecture of Customer Journey Analytics provides for much more flexibility than Adobe Analytics. Creating a new XDM schema is a key way to unlock that flexibility. When you upgrade to Customer Journey Analytics, make sure that you avoid carrying forward unnecessary Adobe Analytics restrictions into your schema.

| Adobe Analytics data architecture | XDM schema architecture | 
|---------|----------|
| Individual metrics are added to the Analytics data architecture.<br/>For example, in Adobe Analytics, you have a different eVar for each event.  | Create individual metrics in the data view rather than in the XDM schema. Doing so provides more flexibility in if you need to make changes at a later time.<br/>For example, in Customer Journey Analytics, you have a single event in the schema, and use create events in the data view.  | 
| Props and eVars are required to create custom variables. | B2 |

## Identify your data team and other stakeholders throughout your organization


## Consider other Adobe Experience Platform applications used in your organization
