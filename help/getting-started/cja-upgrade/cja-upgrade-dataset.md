<!-- Should we single source this instead of duplicate it? The following steps were copied from: /help/data-ingestion/aepwebsdk.md-->

A dataset is the construct that stores and manages the data that you collect into Adobe Experience Platform.

To create a dataset:

1. In Adobe Experience Platform, in the left rail, select **[!UICONTROL Datasets]** within [!UICONTROL DATA MANAGEMENT].

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Create dataset]**.

   ![Create dataset](assets/create-dataset.png)

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Create dataset from schema]**.

   ![Create dataset from schema](assets/create-dataset-from-schema.png)

1. Select the schema that you created earlier and select **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

1. Name your dataset and (optional) provide a description.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Finish]**.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Profile]** switch.

   You are prompted to enable the dataset for profile. Once enabled, the dataset enriches real-time customer profiles with its ingested data.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >    You can only enable a dataset for profile when the schema, to which the dataset adheres, is also enabled for profile.
