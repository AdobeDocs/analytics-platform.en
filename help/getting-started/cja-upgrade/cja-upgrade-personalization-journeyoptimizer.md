By leveraging the state-of-the-art technologies in supervised machine learning and deep learning, Personalized optimization allows a business user (marketer) to define business goals and utilizes their customer data to train business-oriented models to serve personalized offers and maximize KPIs.

For more information, see [Personalized optimization model](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/journey-optimizer/using/decisioning/offer-decisioning/rankings/ai-models/personalized-optimization-model) in the Journey Optimizer Guide.

The result of the personalization object ends up in a dataset. The result of experimentation. When a customer has used AA with Target, that ends up in a complete different space than when they're migrating to CJA and they're going to use CJA with Adobe Target. 

Target was the old way of setting up an A/B test or experimentation. Then ensuring the results of those tests in Target ended up in AA for reporting. Now if you're using Target, instead of saying that you want the data in Target, you can now select CJA as your reporting source for an Adobe Target activity. So if a customer is doing this in AA and they want to move to CJA, ...

If a customer has AJO, and is using Offers in AJO, then they can set up offers, and that also creates datasets in Platform... But that's not relevant with upgrade, exactly.



Questions we need to answer:

1. How do we determine the personalization criteria (Red for user A and blue for User B)

1. What do we implement on the site to determine the red / blue object?


2 ways we can do it:

Manually rendering content or Automatically rendering content. 


## Manual implementation of the Web SDK


## Mobile SDK implementation
