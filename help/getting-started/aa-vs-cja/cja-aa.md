## Supported in a new way {#new-support}

| Feature | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Audience publishing | Supported if licensed with Adobe's Customer Data Platform or Journey Optimizer products. [Audience Publishing](/help/components/audiences/audiences-overview.md) sends audiences to Real-time Customer Profile in Experience Platform. |
| Classifications | Now called "Lookup Datasets". Classifications used in Analytics can be imported to the Experience Platform and Customer Journey Analytics using the Analytics Classifications Source Connector. Lookup datasets can also be uploaded to Experience Platform directly and made available in Customer Journey Analytics. |
| Classification rule builder | Supported using [substrings](/help/data-views/component-settings/substring.md) in Customer Journey Analytics. Uses string manipulations at report time rather than lookup datasets. |
| Custom session length | Session length can be configured through [Session settings](../../data-views/create-dataview.md#session-settings) in a Data view. See  [Session settings](../../data-views/session-settings.md) for more information. <br/>Handling of mobile background events is supported through the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK. See [Lifecycle for Edge Network](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/documentation/lifecycle-for-edge-network/) for more information. |
| Currency conversion | Supported as part of [formatting a metric component](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/format.html?lang=en#currency) in a data view. |
| Merchandising variable persistence | Full Support via [binding dimensions and binding metrics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/persistence.html#binding-dimension) |
| Customer attributes | Now called "Profile Datasets", they do not get automatically imported from Experience Cloud, but must be uploaded to Experience Platform before they are available in Customer Journey Analytics. |
| Data feeds | First-generation data export of datasets is available through the [Experience Platform Data Access API](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-access/api.html?lang=en) and through [Experience Platform Destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/activate/export-datasets.html?lang=en). These options provide event/row level export of all data collected or ingested into Experience Platform Data Lake. Post process data columns are not available because post columns are computed at query time. Export of post columns is available through reporting. |
| Data Warehouse reporting | [Customer Journey Analytics Full Table Export](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md) is the evolution of Data Warehouse reports in Adobe Analytics, with many new, often-requested features that are not available in Data Warehouse today. |
| Entries, Exits, and Time spent dimensions and metrics | Supported (Entries and Exits are now called Session Starts and Session Ends) and are calculated in a slightly different way. |
| eVar persistence settings | eVars are no longer part of Customer Journey Analytics. However, persistence settings are now part of Data Views and are available for all dimensions. Keep in mind that persistence is based on report time processing, not data collection processing. Dimensions set within Data Views are limited to a 90-day max persistence and do not support unlimited persistence. |
| Geosegmentation dimensions | All GeoSegmentation/geography collected into Adobe Analytics flows into Customer Journey Analytics through the [Analytics source connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/analytics.html). Implementations that do not use the Analytics source connector, but rely on the Experience Platform Web SDK for digital data collection, can use the [Experience Edge Geo Lookup service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/datastreams/configure.html). |
| IP obfuscation | For Customer Journey Analytics customers using the Analytics source connector to populate data from Adobe Analytics into Customer Journey Analytics: IP obfuscation settings applied in Adobe Analytics flow through to your Customer Journey Analytics data. You can control these settings in Adobe Analytics as needed.<p>For Customer Journey Analytics customers using Experience Platform Web SDK to populate data into Platform and Customer Journey Analytics directly. You can use Data Prep for Data Collection in Platform to configure rules that obfuscates the IP address based on your company's requirements. |
| Marketing channels | When using the Analytics source connector, Marketing Channels data flows into Customer Journey Analytics through that connector. Marketing Channel rules are configured in traditional Adobe Analytics and some rules are not supported. See [Customer Journey Analytics Marketing Channels](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-usecases/aa-data/marketing-channels.html) for more information. <br/>For WebSDK implementations, report-time marketing channel processing rules are supported through [Derived fields](../../data-views/derived-fields/derived-fields.md). |
| Metric deduplication | Now configured on metrics within Data Views. Metric deduplication happens at the person or session level rather than the Dataset, Data view, or Connection level. |
| New vs. repeat session reporting | Formerly accomplished using the Visit Number dimension. New vs. Repeat sessions are supported [with a 13-month lookback window](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-usecases/data-views/data-views-usecases.html?lang=en). |
| Processing rules, VISTA rules, Marketing channel processing rules | Supported using Adobe Experience Platform Data Prep functionality as well as [derived fields](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/derived-fields.html) for both WebSDK based datasets and data from the Analytics source connector. |
| Products variable | Within the Experience Platform, users can use an array of objects within a dataset schema to satisfy this use case. Within Customer Journey Analytics, customers can use any number of product variables and are not restricted to a single variable as in Adobe Analytics. |
| Project sharing | Project sharing is only supported between users of Customer Journey Analytics - there is not project sharing between Customer Journey Analytics and the traditional Analysis Workspace. |
| Report Builder | Supported with a new Office 365 plugin for Excel. |
| User permissions/Data access controls | Customer Journey Analytics distinguishes between [Adobe Admin Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services/interface/administration/admin-getting-started.html) product admins, product profile admins, and users. Only product admins can Create/update/delete Connections, Projects, Filters, or Calculated Metrics that were created by other users, while product admins and product profile admins can edit Data views. Additional user permissions are available for things like creating calculated metrics, filters, or annotations. |
| Visualizations | All Workspace visualizations are supported except for the Map visualization. |
| Cross-device/cross-channel stitching | Supported for datasets containing identity information directly (also known as "field-based" stitching). Graph-based stitching is not yet supported, but is planned. See [Stitching](../../stitching/overview.md). |

## Adobe Customer Journey Analytics features not available in Adobe Analytics {#cja-not-aa}

The following table lists features that are available in Customer Journey Analytics, but are not supported in Adobe Analytics.

| Feature | More Details |
| --- | --- |
| Accommodation for any kind of data | Customer Journey Analytics is combined with Experience Platform's ability to hold all kinds of data schemas and types. Using [Experience Data Model (XDM)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html), data can be uniformly represented and organized, ready for combination and exploration. Adobe Analytics is predominantly focused on web and mobile analytics data with some capabilities to [import data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/import/home.html). |
| Unlimited customer dimensions and metrics | Customer Journey Analytics dimensions are unlimited; values can be numeric, text, objects, lists, or mixtures of all. Dimensions can be nested or hierarchical. Analytics supports up to a maximum of 75 props and 250 eVars. |
| Unlimited unique values | Customer Journey Analytics supports unlimited unique values or dimension items that can be reported on within a single dimension. Adobe Analytics is limited to 500.000 unique values. The unlimited unique values or dimensions removes reporting and analysis limitations currently existing with large-scale Analytics implementation. |
| Report-time transformations | Data views in Customer Journey Analytics allow you to further interpret data from a connection. You can alter or remove data without changing your implementation, use substrings to manipulate dimensions, create metrics from any value, or filter subevents. All of these transformations are done non-destructively. Adobe Analytics provides limited capabilities through virtual report suites and custom session length. |
| Experimentation analysis | Customer Journey Analytics can evaluate the lift and confidence of any experiment from any data source defined as part of a connection. This evaluation allows you to understand cause-and-effect relationships between customer interactions spanning any channel. Analytics is limited to experimentation analysis through A4T. |
| Cross-Device Analytics | Customer Journey Analytics supports the seamless combination of device-specific datasets from unauthenticated and authenticated sessions. Customer Journey Analytics offers to backfill historical data to known devices. In Analytics, this capability is limited to a single report suite and the use of a device graph. |
| SQL access | Using the Data Distiller option, Customer Journey Analytics can remove the limitations of data collected on Adobe's backend processing. You can modify your data with SQL, create values and datasets unique to your business and continue to explore. Analytics does not support any kind of SQL access to its data. |
| Enhanced security and privacy options - HIPAA readiness | Customer Journey Analytics is HIPAA ready and offers additional security options for regulation compliance. Adobe Analytics is not HIPAA ready. |
| Ability to combine datasets (such as Adobe Analytics report suites) | Customer Journey Analytics allows you to combine data from multiple report suites as if they were a single report suite in Adobe Analytics. |
| Derived Fields | Derived fields allow for report-time transformations to your data. Data can be combined, corrected, or created on the fly and applies retroactively to all reporting. |
| Guided analysis | Guided analysis is a reporting format that allows users to quickly self-serve their data needs so that they can get high-quality insights quickly and make more data-driven decisions. Guided analysis is part of Adobe Product Analytics, an add-on to Customer Journey Analytics.  |
