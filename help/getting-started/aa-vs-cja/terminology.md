# Compare terminology for Analytics data passed through the Analytics Source Connector

Some terminology differences exist between Adobe Analytics, Data Feeds, Analytics Source Connector/Data Lake, and CJA. This topic aims to highlight and clarify those differences.

In Adobe Analytics, deduplication occurs at data processing time. In CJA, deduplication occurs at report runtime, providing more flexibility.
