# Compare terminology for Analytics data passed through the Analytics source connector

Some terminology differences exist between Adobe Analytics, Data Feeds, Analytics source connector/Data Lake, and Customer Journey Analytics. This topic aims to highlight and clarify those differences.

In Adobe Analytics, deduplication occurs at data processing time. In Customer Journey Analytics, deduplication occurs at report runtime, providing more flexibility.
