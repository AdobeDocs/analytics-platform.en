# Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition

{{b2b-edition}}

Adobe Analytics started as a web and digital analytics tool for marketers, while Customer Journey Analytics broadened the scope to include multi-channel, offline, and cross-platform data.  Both tools help Business to Consumer (B2C) companies analyze and optimize their marketing efforts and customer experiences. And focus on **person-based reporting and analysis**: understand the customer journey, where the customer is a person that interacts with your brand across multiple channels.

Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition adds **account-based reporting and analysis**. In B2B (business-to-business) sales, the purchase journey involves multiple parties, online and offline touchpoints, and key stages before closing a deal. B2B companies need to track all these interactions in a unified journey view to effectively analyze and optimize their marketing efforts and account experiences.

Typical B2B sales characteristics are:

* large transaction amounts
* long sales cycles
* multiple decision makers and influencers, usually forming a "buying group"
* more educated buyers
* increased importance on customer retention and upsell
* millennial B2B buyers expect a more seamless "digital consumer" like buying experience

B2B marketing focuses on optimizing touchpoints and reducing the purchase and consideration cycle. Since B2B sales cycles rely heavily on in-person meetings, offline interactions such as live events, and working with buying groups, digital person-based data alone isn't enough. B2B organizations supplement this with data from CRM systems and specialized solutions. Yet traditional B2C marketing components, likreads, campaigns, channels, and site visitors still play a crucial role in B2B marketing.

B2B sales and marketing have evolved beyond traditional lead generation funnels to focus on customer lifecycles and buying groups. This shift reflects the changing nature of B2B purchasing, where decisions involve multiple stakeholders across various touchpoints. Today's B2B buyers follow a complex, non-linear decision-making process. Like B2C customers, they prefer to research independently before engaging with sales teams. Word of mouth and social media now play key roles in shaping their buying decisions.

B2B marketers face growing pressure to demonstrate how their activities contribute to revenue generation.  While aligning marketing efforts with business goals and measuring revenue impact is crucial, many measurement tools are designed for B2C scenarios. As a result, B2B marketers are seeking dedicated tools that provide accurate insights and align with their specific objectives.

Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition helps B2B companies align their marketing, sales, and product teams by providing actionable account insights that drive revenue growth. With the account placed at the center of the data model, all analysis focuses on the account journey. Adding a new layer of entities (accounts, opportunities, and buying groups) on top of person and time-based events, creates a complete picture of the B2B marketing and revenue lifecycle.
