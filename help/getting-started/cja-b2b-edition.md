# Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition

{{release-limited-testing}}

Where Adobe Analytics began as a web and digital analytics tool for marketers, Customer Journey Analytics expanded the scope of analysis to include multi-channel, offline, and call center data. The primary purpose of both Adobe Analytics and Customer Journey Analytics is to provide a Business to Consumer (B2C) company with the tools needed to analyze and optimize the marketing efforts and experience for customers.

For businesses that sell to other businesses (B2B) the purchase journey includes multiple people, multiple touch points, and key stages that lead to a sale. A typical B2B company needs to see all these data points in a single journey to analyze and optimize the marketing efforts and experience for business accounts.

Typical B2B sales characteristics are:

* large transaction amounts, 
* long sales cycle, 
* multiple decision makers or buying groups, 
* more educated buyers, and 
* an increased importance on retention and upsell. 
  
B2B marketing looks to maximize each touch point and reduce the time to purchase. More emphasis on in-person and offline interactions plus the focus on buying groups means that traditional digital person-based data is insufficient. Additional data is often collected through CRM systems and other point solutions. Traditional B2C marketing concepts such as ads, campaigns, channels, and visitors still play an important role in the B2B marketing story.

B2B sales and marketing are undergoing a major shift from traditional lead generation funnels to a full customer lifecycle and buying group approach. B2B buyers expect a more self-service, B2C-like, experience during the B2B sales process and conduct extensive research before engaging with the sales team. Word of mouth and social media increasingly influence B2B buying decisions. 

B2B marketing face increasing pressure to demonstrate how their activities contribute to revenue generation. Aligning marketing efforts with business goals and measuring revenue impact has become critical to demonstrate marketing value. Many existing measurement tools are designed for B2C scenarios. Therefore, B2B marketers are looking to invest in dedicated tools that provide accurate insights and align with B2B objectives.

Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition aligns marketing, sales, and product teams at B2B companies through actionable account insights to drive revenue growth. By placing the account at the center of the data model, analysis revolves around the account journey. The addition of a new layer of entities (account, opportunity, and buying group) on top of person and time-based events provides the power to build a complete picture of the B2B marketing and revenue lifecycle.

Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition is an add-on package to Customer Journey Analytics. The B2B Edition is built upon and extends the functionality and user interface of standard Customer Journey Analytics.


In the documentation specific B2B functionality, only available with the additional Customer Journey Analytics B2B Edition add-on package, is marked with [!BADGE B2B Edition]{type=Informative}.
