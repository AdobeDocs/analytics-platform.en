# IP addresses used by Customer Journey Analytics

Some firewall configurations block IP addresses originating from Adobe's data collection servers or servers responsible for accessing data. You can use this list of ranges to alter your organization's firewall settings to allow access and to send data from within your organization. 

This page includes ip addresses you need to add to your allowlist in order for outbound systems to function, such as [exporting data to a cloud provider](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>While Adobe does its best to keep this document current, it cannot guarantee that the list of IP ranges remains the same. Possible changes include growth and expansion of the business, an internet registry requires changes to Adobe's IP address space, or an internet service provider stops functioning.
