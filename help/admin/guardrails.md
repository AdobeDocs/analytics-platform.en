# Customer Journey Analytics Guardrails

This document provides limits for various components of Customer Journey Analytics. For guardrails, scoping parameters, and entitlements, see the [Product Description for Customer Journey Analytics](https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/customer-journey-analytics.html) or the [Product Description for Adobe Analytics Add-on: Customer Journey Analytics](https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/adobe-analytics-addon-customer-journey-analytics.html).

## Limit types

There are two types of default limits within this document: 

| Guardrail type | Description|
|----------|---------|
| **Performance guardrails (soft limit)** | Performance guardrails are usage limits that relate to the scoping of your use cases. When exceeding performance guardrails, you may experience performance degradation and latency. Adobe is not responsible for such performance degradation. Customers who consistently exceed a performance guardrail  may elect to license additional capacity to avoid performance degradation.|
| **System-enforced guardrails (hard limit)** | System-enforced guardrails are enforced by the Customer Journey Analytics UI or API. These are limits that you cannot exceed as the UI and API block you from doing so or return an error.|

{style="table-layout:auto"}

Some of the features and their associated value for the limit depend on the Customer Journey Analytics package you are entitled to. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The values outlined in this document are subject to change based on continuing improvements in the product. Check back regularly for updates. If you are interested in learning about custom limits, contact your customer care representative.
