# Use components in Analysis Workspace

Components make up the actual data of any project in Analysis Workspace. Components consist of dimensions, metrics, filters, and date ranges. You can add components to a project by dragging them into visualizations or panels.

See the [Components overview](/help/components/overview.md) for more information on the types of components that you can add.

## Add components to a project

1. [Create a project in Analysis Workspace](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/create-projects.md).

1. [Add a panel](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md#create-a-panel) or [add a visualization](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md#add-visualizations-to-a-panel) to the project in Analysis Workspace. If you add a component to a blank project, a freeform table visualization is already created for you.

1. Select ![Curate](/help/assets/icons/Curate.svg) **[!UICONTROL Components]** from the button panel. You see all available components in the left panel. See [Interface](/help/analysis-workspace/home.md#interface) for more details.

1. Scroll to or search for the component that you want to add, then drag it to a panel or visualization within your project. 

1. You can optionally drag a component to the filter drop zone in a panel header. This drag and drop defines the component as a filter and applies the filter to all the content within the panel.
   For information about how you can use the filter drop zone on a panel to filter your panel, see [Drop zone](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md#drop-zone) in [Panels overview](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md).

1. For more detailed information, see the following sections:

   * [Add dimensions to a project](#add-dimensions-to-a-project)

   * [Add metrics to a project](#add-metrics-to-a-project)

   * [Add filters to a project](#add-filters-to-a-project)

   * [Add date ranges to a project](#add-date-ranges-to-a-project)

### Add dimensions to a project

[Dimensions](/help/components/dimensions/overview.md) are variables in Customer Journey Analytics that typically contain string values. In contrast, [metrics](/help/components/calc-metrics/calc-metr-overview.md) contain numeric values that tie to a dimension. A basic report shows rows of string values (dimension), against a column of numeric values (metric).

1. Start adding a dimension to your project in Analysis Workspace, as described in [Add components to a project](#add-components-to-a-project).

1. Choose one of the following methods to add dimensions and determine the type of data you want to analyze:

   ![Add a dimension](/help/components/assets/add-dimension.gif)

   * Drag a dimension to a visualization (such as a freeform table) in Analysis Workspace.
   
   * Drag one or more dimensions from the left panel onto the filter drop zone to create a quick filter, as described in [Add filters to a project](#add-filters-to-a-project).

1. You can optionally break down dimensions and dimension items in Analysis Workspace with other components. For more information, see [Break down dimensions in Workspace](/help/components/dimensions/t-breakdown-fa.md).

For more information about how to use dimensions in Analysis Workspace, see [Preview dimensions](/help/components/dimensions/view-dimensions.md), [Break down dimensions](/help/components/dimensions/t-breakdown-fa.md), and [Time-parting dimensions](/help/components/dimensions/time-parting-dimensions.md).

### Add metrics to a project

Metrics allow you to quantify data points in Analysis Workspace. They are most commonly used as columns in a visualization and tied to dimensions.

To add a metric to a project in Analysis Workspace:

1. Start adding a metric to your project in Analysis Workspace,as described in [Add components to a project](#add-components-to-a-project).



1. Choose one of the following methods to add a metric in Analysis Workspace:

   ![Adding a metric](/help/components/assets/add-metric.gif)

   * Drag a metric to the metric drop zone in an empty Freeform table to see that metric trended over the project's date period. 

   * Drag a metric when a dimension is present to see that metric for each dimension item. 

   * Drag a metric on top of an existing metric header to replace it.

   * Drag a metric next to the left of right side of an existing metric header to add the new metric.

   * Drag a metric above or below an existing metric header to create a metric overlap.

     
For more information about metrics, see [Metrics](/help/components/apply-create-metrics.md).

### Add filters to a project

[Filters](/help/components/filters/filters-overview.md) allow you to identify subsets of persons, sessions or events based on characteristics or specific interactions.

You can use filters in Analysis Workspace in any of the following ways:

* Add filters to a panel
  When you add filters to a panel, the filters apply to all content within the panel.
  For information about how you can use the filter drop zone on a panel to filter your panel, see [Drop zone](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md#drop-zone) in [Panels overview](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md).

* Add filters to a visualization
  When you add filters to a column in a freeform table, the filters apply to all content within the table column. You can also add filters as part of a fallout visualization.

* Use filters in components
  Whe you define components like [calculated metrics](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/metrics-with-segments.md), [annotations](/help/components/annotations/create-annotations.md#annotation-builder), or even [filters](/help/components/filters/filter-builder.md) you can use filters as part of the definition.


### Add date ranges to a project

[Date ranges](/help/components/date-ranges/overview.md) determine the reporting time frame in Analysis Workspace, and can be applied to one or more panels within a project and also to some visualizations (like the Freeform table).

Each panel includes a date range by default. There are multiple ways to update a date range for a panel. One way to update a date range for a panel in Analysis Workspace is to drag a date range component from the left panel:

1. Optionally, add a date range to your project in Analysis Workspace, as described in [Add components to a project](#add-components-to-a-project).

1. Drag and drop a date range from the left panel onto:

   * The current date range, to modify the date range for the panel.

      ![Drop a date range](assets/add-date-range.gif)

   * A metric or dimension in a Freeform table visualization. See [Use date ranges](/help/components/date-ranges/overview.md#use-date-ranges) for more information.

For more information about how to use and manage date ranges in Analysis Workspace, see [Date ranges overview](/help/components/date-ranges/overview.md).

## Component info

You can hover over any component to display ![More info](/help/assets/icons/InfoOutline.svg). When selected, a popup is displayed with additional information on the component. 

![Component info](assets/component-info.png)

Based on your access control, you can:

* Access the ![Bookmark](/help/assets/icons/Bookmark.svg) [!UICONTROL Data dictionary] definition for the component.
* Access the ![Edit](/help/assets/icons/Edit.svg) component builder or data view where the component is defined.
