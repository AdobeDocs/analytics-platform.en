## Analysis Workspace components

Components in Analysis Workspace consist of metrics, dimensions, filters, and date ranges that you can drag-and-drop onto panels and visualizations in your Workspace project. Custom components that you create are added to these panels, such as a calculated metric, or a custom date range.

To access the Components panel, select ![Curate](/help/assets/icons/Curate.svg) **[!UICONTROL Components]** in the button panel.
