# Components overview

Components are features in Customer Journey Analytics that can be used in reports, or to complement reporting features. You can manage these components using the following steps:

1. Log in to [analytics.adobe.com](https://analytics.adobe.com) using your Adobe ID credentials.
2. Navigate to [!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Components] in the header menu.

You can manage the following components:

* [**Annotations**](/help/components/annotations/overview.md): Communicate contextual data nuances and insights to your organization.
* [**Audiences**](/help/components/audiences/audiences-overview.md): Create and publish audiences discovered in Customer Journey Analytics to [Real-time Customer Profile](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/home.html?lang=en) (RTCDP) in Adobe Experience Platform for customer targeting and personalization.
* [**Filters**](filters/filters-overview.md): Build, manage, share, and apply powerful, focused audience filters to your reports. Filters let you identify subsets of persons based on characteristics or interactions.
* [**Calculated metrics**](calc-metrics/calc-metr-overview.md): Use metrics and formulas as new components for use in reporting
* [**Data Dictionary**](/help/components/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-overview.md): Helps both users and administrators keep track of and better understand the components in their Analytics environment.
* [**Date ranges**](date-ranges/create.md): Customize and refine the date ranges Analysis Workspace offers.
* [**Dimensions**](/help/components/dimensions/view-dimensions.md): Dimensions are variables that typically contain string values. Common dimensions include Page and Referring domain.
* [**Metrics**](/help/components/apply-create-metrics.md): Allow you to quantify data points in Analysis Workspace.
* [**Projects**](/help/analysis-workspace/home.md): Organize and maintain your projects in Analysis Workspace.

## Analysis Workspace components

Components in Analysis Workspace consist of metrics, dimensions, filters, and time granularities that you can drag-and-drop onto a project. Custom components that you create are added to these panels, such as custom date ranges.

To access the Components panel, click the **[!UICONTROL Components]** icon in the left rail. You can switch among Panels (Blank panel, [Freeform panel](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md), [Quick Insights](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/quickinsight.md), or [Attribution IQ](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/attribution.md) panel), [Visualizations](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-analysis-visualizations.md), and Components using the left-rail icons or by using [hotkeys](/help/analysis-workspace/build-workspace-project/fa-shortcut-keys.md).

   | [!UICONTROL **Approve**] | Mark components as Approved to signal to your users that the component is organization-approved. Like tags, you can search by Approved in the left rail and filter by them in the component managers. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Share**] | Share components to users in your organization. This option is available for custom components only, such as filters or calculated metrics. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Delete**] | Delete components that you no longer need. This option is available for custom components only, such as filters or calculated metrics. |

Custom components can also be managed through their respective Component managers. For example, the [Manage filters](/help/components/filters/manage-filters.md).

## Search, filter, and sort the component list

   The type of component can be identified by both color and icon. **Dimensions** ![Dimension icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Data_18_N.svg) are orange, **Filters** ![Filter icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Segmentation_18_N.svg) are blue, **Date ranges** ![Date range icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Calendar_18_N.svg) are purple, and **Metrics** ![Metric icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Event_18_N.svg) are green. The Adobe icon ![Adobe icon](assets/default-calc-metric-icon.png) indicates either a calculated metric template or a filter template, and the calculator icon ![Calculator icon](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Calculator_18_N.svg) indicated a calculated metric that was created by an Analytics administrator in your organization.
