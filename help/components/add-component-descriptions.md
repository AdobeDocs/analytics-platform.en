# Add component descriptions

Descriptions help users know how to use the various components when building projects in Analysis Workspace or when viewing reports. 

Customer Journey Analytics administrators can add descriptions for components (dimensions, metrics, segments, and date Ranges) within a data view or using the Data Dictionary. 

## Add descriptions in a data view

You can add a description to a component you have added to your data view. See [Component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/overview.md).

## Add descriptions using the Data Dictionary

The Data Dictionary in Analysis Workspace helps both users and administrators keep track of and better understand the components in their Customer Journey Analytics environment. The Data Dictionary includes the ability, for administrators, to add component descriptions directly within Analysis Workspace. 

For information about adding a component description in the data dictionary, see [Edit component entries in the Data Dictionary](/help/components/data-dictionary/edit-entries-data-dictionary.md).

For general information about the Data Dictionary, see the [Data Dictionary overview](/help/components/data-dictionary/data-dictionary-overview.md).
