# Manage alerts


You can filter, tag, delete, rename, copy, enable, disable renew, and export alerts from a central [!UICONTROL Alerts] management interface. To manage alerts:

* Select **[!UICONTROL Components]** in the main interface, then select **[!UICONTROL Alerts]**.

The Alerts manager is structured very much like the [Filter manager](/help/components/filters/manage-filters.md) and the [Calculated metric manager](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-manager.md).


## Alerts manager

The Alerts manager has the following interface elements:

### Alerts list

The alerts list ➊ displays all the alerts that you own, the alerts that have been scoped to all your projects, and the alerts that have been shared with you. The list has the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| ![StarOutline](/help/assets/icons/StarOutline.svg)  | Select to favor ![Star](/help/assets/icons/Star.svg) or un-favor ![StarOutline](/help/assets/icons/StarOutline.svg) an alert. |
| **[!UICONTROL Title and description]** | To edit the alert, select the title link, which opens the [Alerts builder](alert-builder.md#alert-builder).|
| **[!UICONTROL Type]** | Shows whether the  alert is a Customer Journey Analytics data alert or a Server call usage alert. | 
| **[!UICONTROL Enabled]** | Indicates whether the alert is enabled or disabled. | 
| **[!UICONTROL Data view]** | The data views that this alert applies to.  | 
| **[!UICONTROL Owner]** | The owner of the alert. As a non-administrator, you only see alerts you own or those that are shared with you. |
| **[!UICONTROL Tags]** | The tags for this alert. |
| **[!UICONTROL Expiration Date]** | The date and time when the alert is set to expire. | 
| **[!UICONTROL Date modified]** | The date and time that the alert was last modified. |

<!-- When "Last used" column is added, add this information as the description: Shows the date when the alert was last used. <p>This information can help you determine whether a component is valuable to users in your organization, where it is used, and if it needs to be deleted or modified.</p><p>Consider the following when viewing this column:</p><ul><li>This information does not include usage from the API, Report Builder, or Data Warehouse.</li><li>For some components, this column might not contain data if the component was last used prior to September 2023.</li></ul> -->

## Edit alerts

You can edit an alert

* In the [[!UICONTROL Alert] list](#alerts-list), select the title of the alert.

You use the [Alert builder](alert-builder.md#alert-builder) to edit the alert.

## Troubleshoot an alert

When troubleshooting an issue with an alert, provide the JID (Job Instance ID) number to Adobe Support. The JID number is located at the bottom of the alert email notification you receive.
