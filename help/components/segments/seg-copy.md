# Copy segments

In the [Segment manager](seg-manage.md), you can copy segments. Copying a segment is convenient when you want to create a slightly modified version of an existing segment or want to redefine a segment you do not own and you cannot edit.

1. In the [Segment manager](seg-manage.md), select one or more of the segments you want to copy.
1. From the action bar, select ![Copy](/help/assets/icons/Copy.svg) **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.

The segments are copied and appear in the segment list with the same name as their original but with (Copy) appended to it.
