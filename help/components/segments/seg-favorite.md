# Mark segments as favorite

You can mark a segment as a favorite. To mark segments as favorite helps you to organize your segments. All users can favor segments.

To favor or unfavor a segment, in the [Segment manager](/help/components/segments/seg-manage.md):

* Select ![StarOutline](/help/assets/icons/StarOutline.svg) to favor, or select ![Star](/help/assets/icons/Star.svg) to unfavor a segment.

You can sort your list of segments by favorites. Select **[!UICONTROL Other segments]** from the ![Segment](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) **[!UICONTROL Segment]** panel and select **[!UICONTROL Favorites]**. See [Segment the list of segments](/help/components/segments/seg-filter.md) for more information.
