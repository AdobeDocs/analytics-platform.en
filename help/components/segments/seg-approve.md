# Approve segments

In the [Segment manager](seg-manage.md), you can approve and unapprove segments. Only administrators can approve segments.

To approve segments:

1. In the [Segment manager](seg-manage.md), select one or more of the segments you want to approve.
1. From the action bar, select ![CheckmarkCircle](/help/assets/icons/CheckmarkCircle.svg) **[!UICONTROL Approve]**. The approved segments are indicated with ![CheckmarkCircle](/help/assets/icons/CheckmarkCircle.svg)
   
To unapprove segments:

1. In the [Segment manager](seg-manage.md), select one or more of the segments you want to unapprove.
1. From the action bar, select ![CheckmarkCircle](/help/assets/icons/CheckmarkCircle.svg) **[!UICONTROL Unapprove]**.
   

You can segment your list of segments by approved segments. Select **[!UICONTROL Other segments]** from the ![Segment](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) **[!UICONTROL Segment]** panel and select **[!UICONTROL Approved]**. See [Filter the list of segments](/help/components/segments/seg-filter.md) for more information.
