# Use segments

To use segments across Analysis Workspace you simply drag one or more segments from **[!UICONTROL Segments]** in the component rail and drop on:

* A [panel](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md) in Analysis Workspace to segment all visualizations in the panel.
* A header row in a [freeform table](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md) in Analysis Workspace to replace the dimension.
* A row in a [freeform table](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md) in Analysis Workspace to initiate a breakdown. 
* A column in a [freeform table](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table.md) in Analysis Workspace to add or replace a column, or to initiate a filter.
* Configurations panels for visualization or panels that allow to drop segments. For example, in a [Quick insights](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/quickinsight.md) panel, or [Key metric](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/key-metric.md) summary visualization
* The [definition builder for a segment](/help/components/segments/seg-builder.md#definition-builder), so you include a segment in your segment definition.
* The [definition builder for a calculated metric](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-build-metrics.md#definition-builder), so you include a segment in your calculated metric definition.
