# Configure cloud export locations

{{release-limited-testing}}

Before you can export Customer Journey Analytics reports to a cloud destination as described in [Export Customer Journey Analytics reports to the cloud](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md), you need to add and configure the location where you want the data to be sent. 

This process consists of adding and configuring the account (such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Platform, and so forth) as described in [Configure cloud export accounts](/help/components/exports/cloud-export-accounts.md), and then adding and configuring the location within that account (such as a folder within the account) as described in this article.

For information about how to manage existing locations, including viewing, editing, and deleting locations, see [Manage cloud export locations and accounts](/help/components/exports/manage-export-locations.md).

## Begin creating a cloud export location

1. You need to add an account before you can add a location. If you haven't already, add an account as described in [Configure cloud export accounts](/help/components/exports/cloud-export-accounts.md).

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Components**] > [!UICONTROL **Exports**].

1. Select the [!UICONTROL **Locations**] tab, then select [!UICONTROL **Add location**]. 
   
   ![add location button](assets/location-add.png)

   Or

   Select the [!UICONTROL **Location accounts**] tab, select the 3-dot icon on an existing account where you want to add a location, then select [!UICONTROL **Add location**].

   ![Add location to existing account](assets/add-location-existing-account.png)

   The Location dialog displays.

1. Specify the following information:
   |Field | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Name**] | The name of the location.  | 
   | [!UICONTROL **Description**] | Provide a short description of the account to help differentiate it from other accounts of the same account type. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Location account**] | Select the account where you want to create the location. For information about how to create an account, see [Configure cloud export accounts](/help/components/exports/cloud-export-accounts.md). | 

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Location properties**] section, specify information specific to the account type of your location account.  

   Continue with the section below that corresponds to the account type that you selected in the [!UICONTROL **Location account**] field.

### AEP Data Landing Zone

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>When exporting Customer Journey Analytics reports to Adobe Experience Platform Data Landing Zone, make sure that you download the data within 7 days, then delete it from AEP Data Landing Zone. After 7 days, the data is automatically deleted from AEP Data Landing Zone.

1. [Begin creating a cloud export location](#begin-creating-a-cloud-export-location), as described above.

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Location properties**] section of the [!UICONTROL **Add location**] dialog box, specify the following information to configure an Adobe Experience Platform Data Landing Zone location:

   <!-- still need to update; can't create AEP account -->

   |Field | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Prefix**] | The folder within the container where you want to put the data. Specify a folder name, then add a slash after the name to create the folder. For example, `folder_name/` |

   {style="table-layout:auto"}

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Save**].

1. You can now export data from Analysis Workspace to the account and location that you configured. For information about how to export data to the cloud, see [Export project data to the cloud](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md).

1. The easiest way to access your data in AEP Data Landing Zone is to use the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer. This is the same tool that is used in the instructions to configure the [AEP Data Landing Zone account](/help/components/exports/cloud-export-accounts.md#aep-data-landing-zone).

   1. Open the [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/).

   1. Go to [!UICONTROL **Storage Accounts**] > [!UICONTROL **(Attached Containers)**] > [!UICONTROL **Blob Containers**] > **[!UICONTROL cjaexport-_number_]** > ***your_container_name***.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The folder name **[!UICONTROL cjaexport-_number_]** is the default name provided by Azure Storage Explorer. If you have only a single connection associated with your SAS URI (which is normal), then the name of this folder will be **[!UICONTROL cjaexport-1]**.


      ![Access files in Azure storage explorer](assets/azure-storage-explorer-access.png)

   1. Select the export that you want to download, then select [!UICONTROL **Download**] to download.
