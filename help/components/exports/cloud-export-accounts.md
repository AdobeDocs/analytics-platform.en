# Configure cloud export accounts

Before you can export Customer Journey Analytics reports to a cloud destination as described in [Export Customer Journey Analytics reports to the cloud](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md), you need to add and configure the destination where you want the data to be sent. 

This process consists of adding and configuring the account (such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Platform, and so forth) as described in this article, and then adding and configuring the location within that account (such as a folder within the account) as described in [Configure cloud export locations](/help/components/exports/cloud-export-locations.md).

For information about how to manage existing accounts, including viewing, editing, and deleting accounts, see [Manage cloud export locations and accounts](/help/components/exports/manage-export-locations.md).

## Begin creating a cloud export account

1. Make sure you meet the [minimum requirements](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md#minimum-requirements) for exporting reports to the cloud.
1. In Customer Journey Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Components**] > [!UICONTROL **Exports**].
1. On the [!UICONTROL Exports] page, select the [!UICONTROL **Location accounts**] tab.

   ![Exports page options showing Add another account](assets/account-add.png)

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Add account**]. 
   
   The Add account dialog displays.

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Location account name**] field, specify a name for the location account. This name appears when creating a location.

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Location account description**] field, provide a short description of the account to help differentiate it from other accounts of the same account type.

1. Enable the option to [!UICONTROL **Make account available to all users in your organization**] if you want to allow other users in your organization to use the account. 

   Consider the following when sharing accounts:
   
   * Accounts that you share cannot be unshared.
   
   * Shared accounts can be edited only by the owner of the account.
   
   * Anyone can create a location for the shared account. 

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Account type**] field, select the type of cloud account you are exporting to. Available account types are Amazon S3 Role ARN, Google Cloud Platform, Azure SAS, Azure RBAC, Snowflake, and AEP Data Landing Zone.

1. Continue with the section below that corresponds to the [!UICONTROL **Account type**] you selected.

   * [AEP Data Landing Zone](#aep-data-landing-zone)

   * [Amazon S3 Role ARN](#amazon-s3-role-arn)

   * [Google Cloud Platform](#google-cloud-platform)

   * [Azure SAS](#azure-sas)

   * [Azure RBAC](#azure-rbac)

   * [Snowflake](#snowflake)

### AEP Data Landing Zone

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>When exporting Customer Journey Analytics reports to Adobe Experience Platform Data Landing Zone, make sure that you download the data within 7 days, then delete it from AEP Data Landing Zone. After 7 days, the data is automatically deleted from AEP Data Landing Zone.

1. Begin creating a cloud export account in either of the following ways:

   * From the Exports page as described above, in [Begin creating a cloud export account](#begin-creating-a-cloud-export-account)
   
   * When [exporting full tables from Analysis Workspace](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md#export-full-tables-from-analysis-workspace)

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Save**].

   The [!UICONTROL **Export account created**] dialog displays.

   ![Export account dialog AEP Data Landing Zone](assets/export-account-aep.png)

1. Copy the contents of the [!UICONTROL **SAS URI**] field to your clipboard. You will use this SAS URI to access the data that is exported from Analysis Workspace from the AEP Data Landing Zone.

   If this field is empty, you need to be granted permission to access Adobe Experience Platform.

1. In Adobe Experience Platform, configure your Data Landing Zone container to use the SAS URI that you copied.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Because the AEP Data Landing Zone account is based on Azure, the easiest way to access reports that you export to AEP Data Landing Zone is by using the Azure Storage Explorer. The following steps use this method.

   1. If you haven't already, download the [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/).
   
   1. In the Adobe Experience Platform documentation, follow the steps described in [Connect your Data Landing Zone container to Azure Storage Explorer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/data-landing-zone.html#connect-your-data-landing-zone-container-to-azure-storage-explorer).

      You can skip the tasks described in the sections [Retrieve the credentials for your Data Landing Zone](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/data-landing-zone.html#retrieve-dlz-credentials) and [Update Data Landing Zone credentials](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/cloud-storage/data-landing-zone.html#update-dlz-credentials), because the URI that you copied contains these credentials.

   1. When following the Adobe Experience Platform documentation and you come to the [!UICONTROL **Blob container SAS URL**] field, paste the SAS URI that you copied in Step 3.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >You need to perform this action every 7 days, because the SAS URI expires 7 days after it is created. You can create a script to automate this process.


        ![Enter Connection Info window showing SAS URL field](assets/blob-container-sas-uri.png)

   1. Select [!UICONTROL **Next**] > [!UICONTROL **Connect**].

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, in the [!UICONTROL **Export account created**] dialog, select [!UICONTROL **OK**].

   ![Export account dialog AEP Data Landing Zone](assets/export-account-aep.png)

1. Continue with [Configure cloud export locations](/help/components/exports/cloud-export-locations.md).

### Amazon S3 Role ARN

   * From the Exports page as described above, in [Begin creating a cloud export account](#begin-creating-a-cloud-export-account)
   
   * When [exporting full tables from Analysis Workspace](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md#export-full-tables-from-analysis-workspace) 

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Account properties**] section of the [!UICONTROL **Add account**] dialog box, specify the following information:

   |Field | Function | 
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Role ARN**] | You must provide a Role ARN (Amazon Resource Name) that Adobe can use to gain access to the Amazon S3 account.
