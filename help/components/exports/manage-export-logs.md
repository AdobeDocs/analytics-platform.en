# Manage export logs

Export logs provide details about each export, and are generated any time Analysis Workspace data is exported to the cloud. (For information about how data can be exported to the cloud, see [Export Customer Journey Analytics reports to the cloud](/help/analysis-workspace/export/export-cloud.md).) 

For scheduled exports, logs reflect the export settings as they were when the log was sent. Logs cannot be deleted.

## View export logs

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, select [!UICONTROL **Components**] > [!UICONTROL **Exports**].

1. Select the [!UICONTROL **Logs**] tab.

   ![Export window showing the Logs tab](assets/export-logs-tab.png)

   Details for each log are displayed in the available columns. 

1. Do any of the following:

   * [Customize the columns](#configure-columns) that are displayed.

   * Select the **Information icon** ![Information icon](assets/information-icon.png) next to the log name to view the export that is associated with the log.

   * Select the **Edit export icon** ![Information icon](assets/edit-export-icon.png) next to the log name to edit the export that is associated with the log.

   | Account | The account where the data was exported. |
   | Status | The status of the export. Available statuses are [!UICONTROL Pending], [!UICONTROL Delivered], and [!UICONTROL Failed]. |

1. Ensure that any columns you want to display are selected. Selected columns appear on the [!UICONTROL Logs] page and display the relevant information.

## View audit logs

Full-table exports are also tracked in the [Customer Journey Analytics audit logs](/help/privacy/audit-log.md). <!-- Need to see what the Component Type for full-table export will be and add it here. Also, under "Event type captured by audit logs" there would be a new event type called "Full-table export". 4 actions would be "Create, Delete, Edit, Export" and "API_Request"? Also information about the locations. Probably have a different component for the location credentials.-->
