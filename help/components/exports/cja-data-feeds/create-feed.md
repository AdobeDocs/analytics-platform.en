# Create a data feed

When creating a data feed, you provide Adobe with:

* The information about the destination where you want raw data files to be sent

* The data you want to include in each file

* The frequency of how often the data feed should be sent (including the processing delay to capture late-arriving hits)

Before you create a data feed, it's important to have a basic understanding of data feeds and to ensure that you meet all prerequisites. For more information, see [Data feeds overview](data-feed-overview.md).

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Delivery**] section, specify the following information:
   
   | Field | Function |
   |---------|----------|
   | [!UICONTROL **Feed type**] | Select the type of feed you want to create:<ul><li>[!UICONTROL **Live feed**]: Exports current and future data.</li><li>[!UICONTROL **Backfill feed**]: Exports historical data between two past dates.</li></ul>|
   | [!UICONTROL **Start date**] | Specify the date when you want the data feed to begin. To immediately begin processing data feeds for historical data, ensure that [!UICONTROL **Backfill feed**] is selected, then set this date to any date in the past when data is being collected. The start date is based on the data view's time zone. |
   | [!UICONTROL **End date**] | Specify the date when you want the data feed to end. The end date is based on the data view's time zone. |
   | [!UICONTROL **Frequency**] | Select how often the data feed should be sent. Events with timestamps that fall within the frequency window are included in the data feed delivery. The [!UICONTROL **Lookback date range**] and [!UICONTROL **Processing delay**] fields can also affect which events are included in the data for the delivery frequency that you choose.<p>For live feeds, select to include either one hour's worth of data or one day's worth of data. Backfill feeds must be daily.</p><ul><li>**Daily**: Feeds contain a full day's worth of data, from midnight to midnight in the data view's time zone. Use this option for backfill feeds or for live feeds.</li><li>**Hourly**: Feeds contain a single hour's worth of data. Use this option for live feeds.</li></ul>  |
   | [!UICONTROL **Lookback date range**] | Controls how far back Customer Journey Analytics looks when processing the data feed delivery. <p>This setting does not alter the frequency window (hour or day), which defines the time frame of the events to include in the data feed output. However, the lookback date range can influence the data that is delivered, in the following ways: </p><ul><li>**Segment qualification**: When a segment is applied to your data feed definition, any events within the lookback date range determine whether a person qualifies. The segment's container setting determines the scope. (Possible containers are: Person, Session, or Event. B2B has the following additional containers: Global account, Account, Opportunity, Buying group.)  <p>For example, if a Person container is used and the person qualifies during the lookback date range, then all of that person's events during the frequency window also qualify.</p></li><li>**Session calculation**: Session boundaries are calculated using data within the lookback date range.</li><li>**Derived field transformations**: Any derived field functions that reference containers use the lookback date range in data feed exports.</li><li>**Dimension persistence**: If you choose to set persistence on an individual dimension, you also choose an expiration to determine how long a dimension item persists beyond the event it is set on. <p>The lookback date range affects dimension persistence when the expiration is set to either of the following options in the data view:</p><ul><li>For each dimension in the data feed definition that uses [!UICONTROL **Reporting Window**] as its expiration, the lookback date range becomes the new reporting window.</li><li>For each dimension in the data feed definition that uses [!UICONTROL **Custom Time**] as its expiration, and if the custom time that is selected extends beyond the lookback date range, the custom time is ignored, and the lookback date range is used for dimension expiration.<p>For more information about setting persistence on dimensions within the data view, see [Persistence component settings](/help/data-views/component-settings/persistence.md).</p></li></ul>|
   | [!UICONTROL **Processing delay**] | Choose the amount of time to wait before processing a data feed file. Any late-arriving hits that come in during the processing delay are included in the data feed. <p>A delay can be useful to give mobile implementations an opportunity for offline devices to come online and send data. It can also be used to accommodate your organization's server-side processes in managing previously processed files. </p><p>You can delay a feed by 2, 3, 4, or 8 hours.<p>Sessions must start after the processing delay cutoff in order to be included; sessions that start before the cutoff and end within the processing delay are not included.</p>|

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Destination**] section, configure the destination where you want the data to be sent.  

   >[!NOTE]

    For information about how to access the data feed and to get a better understanding of its contents, see [Data feed contents - overview](/help/export/analytics-data-feed/c-df-contents/datafeeds-contents.md).

## Legacy destinations

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The destinations described in this section are legacy, and are not recommended. Instead, use one of the following destinations when creating a data feed: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Platform, Azure RBAC, or Azure SAS. See [Create and configure a data feed](#create-and-configure-a-data-feed) for detailed information about each of these recommended destinations. 


The following information provides configuration information for each of the legacy destinations:

### FTP

Data feed data can be delivered to an Adobe or customer-hosted FTP location. Requires an FTP host, username, and password. Use the path field to place feed files in a folder. Folders must already exist; feeds throw an error if the specified path does not exist.

Use the following information when completing the available fields:

* [!UICONTROL **Host**]: Enter the desired FTP destination URL. For example, `ftp://ftp.omniture.com`.
* [!UICONTROL **Path**]: Can be left blank
* [!UICONTROL **Username**]: Enter the username to log in to the FTP site.
* [!UICONTROL **Password and confirm password**]: Enter the password to log in to the FTP site.

### SFTP

SFTP support for data feeds is available. Requires an SFTP host, username, and the destination site to contain a valid RSA or DSA public key. You can download the appropriate public key when creating the feed.

### S3

You can send feeds directly to Amazon S3 buckets. This destination type requires a Bucket name, an Access Key ID, and a Secret Key. See [Amazon S3 bucket naming requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-s3-bucket-naming-requirements.html) within the Amazon S3 docs for more information.

The user you provide for uploading data feeds must have the following [permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_Operations_Amazon_Simple_Storage_Service.html):

* s3:GetObject
* s3:PutObject
* s3:PutObjectAcl

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >For each upload to an Amazon S3 bucket, [!DNL Analytics] adds the bucket owner to the BucketOwnerFullControl ACL, regardless of whether the bucket has a policy that requires it. For more information, see "[What is the BucketOwnerFullControl setting for Amazon S3 data feeds?](df-faq.md#BucketOwnerFullControl)"

The following 16 standard AWS regions are supported (using the appropriate signature algorithm where necessary):

* us-east-2
* us-east-1
* us-west-1
* us-west-2
* ap-south-1
* ap-northeast-2
* ap-southeast-1
* ap-southeast-2
* ap-northeast-1
* ca-central-1
* eu-central-1
* eu-west-1
* eu-west-2
* eu-west-3
* eu-north-1
* sa-east-1

>[!NOTE]
>
>The cn-north-1 region is not supported.

### Azure Blob

Data feeds support Azure Blob destinations. Requires a container, account, and a key. Amazon automatically encrypts the data at rest. When you download the data, it gets decrypted automatically. See [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=azure-portal#view-and-copy-storage-access-keys) within the Microsoft Azure docs for more information.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must implement your own process to manage disk space on the feed destination. Adobe does not delete any data from the server.
