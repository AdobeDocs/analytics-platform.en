# Manage audiences created in Customer Journey Analytics

Managing previously created audiences lets you:

* **Schedule or de-schedule** automatic audience refresh/update. The maximum expiration on the schedule is 1 year. 
* **Renew an audience refresh schedule** when it is about to expire. Expiring audiences are treated similarly to expiring scheduled reports - the admin gets an email a month before the schedule expires.
* View the **refresh interval** and the **last time an audience was updated**
* Gain insight into the **amount of time it took to produce an audience** from Customer Journey Analytics, and the amount of time it took to have the audience appear in Real-time Customer Profile for activation purposes.
* See whether the audiences in Customer Journey Analytics are **being actively used by Real-time Customer Profile** or (ideally) any Experience Platform applications that consume the audiences created by Customer Journey Analytics.
