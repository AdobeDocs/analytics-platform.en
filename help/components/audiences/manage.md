# Manage audiences

Audiences can be managed in Customer Journey Analytics using **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Audiences]**.

## Understand audience management tasks

Managing previously created audiences lets you:

* **Schedule or de-schedule** automatic audience refresh/update. The maximum expiration on the schedule is 1 year. 
* **Renew an audience refresh schedule** when it is about to expire. Expiring audiences are treated similarly to expiring scheduled reports - the admin gets an email a month before the schedule expires.
* View the **refresh interval** and the **last time that an audience was updated**
* Gain insight into the **amount of time it took to produce an audience** from Customer Journey Analytics. And the amount of time it took to have the audience appear in Real-time Customer Platform for activation purposes.
* See whether the audiences in Customer Journey Analytics are **being actively used by Real-time Customer Platform**. Or (ideally) any Experience Platform applications that consume the audiences created by Customer Journey Analytics.

If you do have [Audience View](/help/technotes/access-control.md#user-level-access) access, you can view audiences. If you do have [Audience Create](/help/technotes/access-control.md#user-level-access) access, you can edit and delete audiences.
