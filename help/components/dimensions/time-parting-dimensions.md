# Time-parting dimensions

Time parting takes the timestamp of collected hits and breaks it into more meaningful dimensions, such as "Hour of Day" or "Day of Week".

Time-parting dimensions are based on the time zone of the data view. These dimensions are available in Analysis Workspace and can help to answer the following questions:

* Across a large date range, what is the most popular time of day for visitors to access my site or app? 
* Are there days of the week, or hours of the day, on which conversion is higher on my site or app? 
* How do my weekend sales compare to my weekday sales? 
* Does a certain marketing campaign generate higher conversions in the morning, or in the afternoon?
