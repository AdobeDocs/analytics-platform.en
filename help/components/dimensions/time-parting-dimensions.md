# Time-parting dimensions in Analysis Workspace

Time parting takes the timestamp of collected events and breaks it into more meaningful dimensions, such as **Hour of Day** or **Day of Week**.

Time-parting dimensions are based on the time zone of the data view. These dimensions are available in Analysis Workspace and can help to answer the following questions:

* Across a large date range, what is the most popular time of day for persons to access my site or app? 
* Are there days of the week, or hours of the day, on which conversion is higher on my site or app? 
* How do my weekend sales compare to my weekday sales? 
* Does a certain marketing campaign generate higher conversions in the morning, or in the afternoon?

| Dimension | Example values |
|--- |--- |
|**[!UICONTROL Hour of Day]**|0-23|
|**[!UICONTROL AM/PM]**|AM, PM|
|**[!UICONTROL Day of Week]**|Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday|
|**[!UICONTROL Weekday/Weekend]**|Weekday, Weekend|
|**[!UICONTROL Day of Month]**|1-31|
|**[!UICONTROL Month of Year]**|January-December|
|**[!UICONTROL Day of Year]**|1-366|
|**[!UICONTROL Quarter of Year]**|Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4|
