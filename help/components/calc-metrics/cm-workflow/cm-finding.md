# Find metrics

You can locate metrics in Analysis Workspace in the same way that you locate other types of components.

For information about how to quickly locate components, see [Search, filter, and sort the component list](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-components/overview.html?lang=en#search%2C-filter%2C-and-sort-the-component-list) in [Components overview](/help/components/overview.md).
