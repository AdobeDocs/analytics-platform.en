# Create calculated metrics

By default, only administrators can create calculated metrics. Users have rights to view calculated metrics, similar to how users view other components (such as filters, annotations, and more).

However, administrators can give the **[!UICONTROL Calculated Metric Creation]** permission for **[!UICONTROL Reporting Tools]** in **[!UICONTROL Edit permissions for CJA Workspace Access]** to users via the [Admin Console](/help/technotes/access-control.md#user-level-access).


You can create a calculated metric in the following ways:

![Ways to create a filter](assets/create-metric.png)

* üÖê In the main interface, select **[!UICONTROL Components]** and select **[!UICONTROL Calculated metrics]**. Select ![AddCircle](/help/assets/icons/AddCircle.svg) [!UICONTROL **[!UICONTROL Add]**] from the [[!UICONTROL Calculated metrics] manager](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-manager.md). 
* üÖë In a Workspace project, from the Components left panel, select ![Add](/help/assets/icons/Add.svg) at ![Event](/help/assets/icons/Event.svg) **Metrics**.
* üÖí In a Workspace project, from the context menu in metrics column header, select **[!UICONTROL Create metric from selection]**. From the submenu, you can select a function, or select **[!UICONTROL Open in calculated metric builder]**. <br/>If you select a function, the calculated metric is defined as a project-only metric. When you later edit this metric, through the [Component info](/help/components/use-components-in-workspace.md#component-info) popup, you a notification in the [Calculated metric builder](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-build-metrics.md).
* üÖì In a Workspace project, select **[!UICONTROL Components]** from the menu, and select **[!UICONTROL Create metric]**. 
* üÖî In a Workspace project, use the shortcut **[!UICONTROL shift+cmd+c]** (macOS) or **[!UICONTROL shift+ctrl+c]** (Windows).

To define the new calculated metric, you use the [Calculated metric builder](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-build-metrics.md).

| Workflow Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Plan Calculated Metrics | Especially for metrics that are going to be officially "approved", it makes sense to outline which calculated metrics will be widely used and how they will be defined. |
| [Build](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-build-metrics.md) Calculated Metrics | Build and edit calculated and advanced calculated metrics for use in [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics] components. |
| [Tag](cm-tagging.md) Calculated Metrics | Tag calculated metrics for ease of organization and sharing. See how to plan and assign tags for simple and advanced searches and organization. |
| [Approve](cm-approving.md) Calculated Metrics | Approve calculated metrics to make them canonical. |
| Apply Calculated Metrics | You can apply metrics directly from a report, from the Metric Selector (to access it, click [!UICONTROL Show Metrics]). |
| Filter Calculated Metrics | In the Metric Selector, click [!UICONTROL Advanced Selection] and filter by tags, owners, and other filters (Show All, Mine, Shared With me, Favorites, and Approved.) |
| Mark Calculated Metrics as [Favorites](cm-finding.md) | Marking metrics as favorites is another way to organize them for ease of use.|
