# Filter the list of calculated metrics

You can filter the list of calculated metrics. Using a filter on calculated metrics makes it easier to find the calculated metrics that are available to you, and manage calculated metrics from the [Calculated metrics manager](cm-manager.md). 


To filter the list of calculated metrics:

1. Select ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) to open the Filters panel. If you need more space for the Filters list, you can select ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) once more to close the panel.
1. Select filters from any of the available [filter sections](#filter-sections). 
   
   >[!INFO]

   >*Items* refer to the filter items displayed in the [Calculated metrics list](cm-manager.md#filters-list).

## Filter sections

{{tagfiltersection}} 
{{dataviewfiltersection}}
{{ownerfiltersection}}
{{otherfiltersfiltersection}}


The [Calculated metrics list](cm-manager.md#filters-list) is automatically updated based on your filter configuration. You can see the configured filters in the [Active filter bar](cm-manager.md#active-filter-bar).
