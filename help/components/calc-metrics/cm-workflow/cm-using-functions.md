# Use functions

Functions let you filter, sort your data and do simple and complex statistical analysis.

For a list of all functions, refer to [Basic functions](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-functions.md) and [Advanced functions](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-adv-functions.md).



>[!NOTE]
>
>When you include functions in the Definition of the calculated metrics builder, always apply the function before dragging in metrics or filters.
