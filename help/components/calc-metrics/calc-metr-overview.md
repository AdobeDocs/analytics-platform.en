# Calculated metrics overview

Calculated and Advanced Calculated (or Derived) Metrics are custom metrics that you can create from existing metrics. Our Calculated Metrics tools offer a highly flexible way of building, managing and curating metrics. They allow you as marketers, product managers and analysts to ask questions of the data without having to change your implementation.

You can

* Create filtered metrics that are derived at report run time, without having to change the implementation. These can be viewed historically because they are based on filters.
* (Advanced Calculated Metrics only) Filter on metrics. For example, you can create a metric for "New persons", with a count of people for whom this is the first session.
* (Advanced Calculated Metrics only) Incorporate statistical functions to help you better describe your data. For example, you can count the number of items in a report or add in the number of standard deviations for each item.
