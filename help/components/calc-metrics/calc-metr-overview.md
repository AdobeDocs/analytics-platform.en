# Calculated metrics overview

Calculated metric are custom metrics that you can create from existing metrics. Calculated metrics offer a flexible way of to  build, manage, and curate custom metrics that enable you to analyze your data without having to change your implementation.

A typical workflow for calculated metrics consists of these tasks

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Plan | Especially, for metrics that are going to be officially approved ![Checkmark](/help/assets/icons/Checkmark.svg), carefully plan and structure the calculated metrics you anticipate being used often.  |
| [Build](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-build-metrics.md) | Build, modify, and save calculated metrics. |
| [Apply](/help/components/use-components-in-workspace.md) | Apply calculated metrics directly within your Workspace projects. |
| [Manage](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-manager.md) | Manage calculated metrics. You can [tag](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-tagging.md), [approve](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-approving.md), [unapprove](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-approving.md), [filter](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-filter.md), [favor](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-favorite.md) or [unfavor](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-favorite.md), [share](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-sharing.md), or [copy](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-copy.md) one or more calculated metrics. |

See [Create calculated metrics](/help/components/calc-metrics/cm-workflow/cm-workflow.md) for the various options available to create calculated metrics. You build, modify, and save the definition of the calculated metrics in the [Calculated metrics builder](cm-workflow/cm-build-metrics.md).

You use calculated metric directly in Analysis Workspace. See [Use components in Analysis Workspace](/help/components/use-components-in-workspace.md)

You manage calculated metrics in the [Calculated metrics manager](cm-workflow/cm-manager.md).

## Default calculated metrics

Adobe provides a number of default calculated metrics, identified by ![AdobeLogoSmall](/help/assets/icons/AdobeLogoSmall.svg). See [Default calculated metrics](/help/components/calc-metrics/default-calcmetrics.md) for more information.
