# Scheduled projects

Scheduled Analysis Workspace projects can be managed in Customer Journey Analytics using **[!UICONTROL Components]** > **[!UICONTROL Scheduled projects]**.

In **[!UICONTROL Scheduled Projects]**, you can edit and delete recurring project schedules.  The [Scheduled project list](#scheduled-project-list) shows the items that a specific user has created. If the user account is disabled in the application, all scheduled deliveries will stop.
