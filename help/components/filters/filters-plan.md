# Plan filters

Devoting some time to plan filters improves the chances that they will be useful for your organization and that their numbers will be kept in check.

* Consider the audience : Who will consume it? With whom will you share it? Which groups of people will use this filter and how should I tag it accordingly? This also means providing a good filter description. At minimum, the description should answer these questions:

    * What is this filter useful for?

    * When should I use this filter? 

* Determine the filter scope . Which [filter container](/help/components/filters/filters-overview.md) best represents the scope? Use the smallest container possible.

* Decide which elements to include in the filter definition, and which values.

* Consider how you want your approval process to unfold. Will a single person review and approve filters or will it be a committee decision?

* Define your filters with view to a filter library that gives business users the ability to stack and reuse filter pieces or components in a modular fashion. What "modules" do you need to define to make this library a reality?
