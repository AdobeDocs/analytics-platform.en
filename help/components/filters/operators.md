# Operators

The Filter builder lets you compare and constrain values for components using selected operators. There are two categories of operators: [[!UICONTROL Standard]](#standard-operators) and [[!UICONTROL Distinct Count]](#distinct-count-operators).

## Standard operators

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[!UICONTROL equals]** | Returns items that match exactly for a numeric or string value. If using wildcard characters, use the matches operator. |
| **[!UICONTROL does not equal]** | Returns all items that do not contain the exact match of the value entered.  If using wildcard characters, use the does not match operator. |
| **[!UICONTROL equals any of]** | Returns any items that contain the match of the substring values entered, delimited by a comma. |
| **[!UICONTROL contains]** | Returns items that compare to the substrings of the values entered. For example, if the value for a Page Name dimension contains `Search`, this operator matches any page that has the substring `Search` in its name, including `Search Results`, `Search`, and `Searching`. This operator is case-sensitive. |
| **[!UICONTROL does not contain]** | All items that match the entered value are excluded from the results. For example, if the value for a Page Name dimension does not contain `Search`, this operator excludes any page that has the substring `Search` in its name, including `Search Results`, `Search`, and `Searching`. |
| **[!UICONTROL contains all of]** | Returns items that include all substrings (separated by a space) in any order. For example, specifying `Search Results` as the value for this operator would match `Search Results` and `Results of Search`, but not `Search` or `Results` independently. This operator supports up to 100 words delimited by spaces. |
| **[!UICONTROL does not contain all of]** | All items that match every entered value are excluded from the results. For example, specifying `Search Results` as the value for this operator would exclude `Search Results` and `Results of Search`, but not `Search` or `Results`. This operator supports up to 100 words delimited by spaces. |
| **[!UICONTROL contains any of]** | Returns items that contain any of the specified substrings. For example, specifying `Search Results` as the value for this operator would match `Search Results`, `Results of Search`, `Search`, and `Results`. This operator supports up to 100 words delimited by spaces. |
| **[!UICONTROL does not contain any of]** | All items that match any substring are excluded from the results. For example, specifying `Search Results` as the value for this operator would exclude `Search Results`, `Results of Search`, `Search`, and `Results`. This operator supports up to 100 words delimited by spaces. |
| **[!UICONTROL starts with]** | Returns items that start with the character or strings of the value specified. |
| **[!UICONTROL does not start with]** | Returns all items that do not start with the characters or strings of the value specified. |
| **[!UICONTROL ends with]** | Returns items that end with the character or strings of the value specified. |
| **[!UICONTROL does not end with]** | Returns all items that do not end with the characters or strings of the value specified. |
| **[!UICONTROL matches]** | Returns items that match items exactly based on a given numeric or string value. Supports wildcards using an asterisk (`*`). This operator is case sensitive. For example:<ul><li>`a*e` matches `ae`, `abcde`, `adobe`, and `a whole sentence`.</li><li>`adob*` matches `adobe`, `adobe analytics`, and `adobo recipe`</li><li>`*dobe` matches `dobe`, `adobe`, and `cute little dobe`.</li></ul>|
| **[!UICONTROL does not match]** | All items that match the string are excluded. Supports wildcards using an asterisk (`*`). |
| **[!UICONTROL exists]** | Returns items if the value is not null. |
| **[!UICONTROL does not exist]** | Returns items if the value is null. |

## Distinct Count operators

You can filter on a distinct count of items within a dimension. For example, you can create filters for persons who viewed more than 5 distinct products or visits where more than 5 distinct pages were seen.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[!UICONTROL equals]** | Returns dimension items whose unique count equals the value entered. |
| **[!UICONTROL does not equal]** | Returns dimension items whose unique count does not equal the value entered. |
| **[!UICONTROL is greater than]** | Returns dimension items whose unique count is greater than the value entered. |
| **[!UICONTROL is less than]** | Returns dimension items whose unique count is less than the value entered. |
| **[!UICONTROL is greater than or equal to]** | Returns dimension items whose unique count is greater than or equal to the value entered. |
| **[!UICONTROL is less than or equal to]** | Returns dimension items whose unique count is less than or equal to the value entered. |
