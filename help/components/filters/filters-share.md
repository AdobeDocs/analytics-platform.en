# Share filters {#share}

Depending on your permissions, you can share filters with your whole organization, groups, or individual users. 

|Administrator| Non-Administrator|
|---|---|
|Can share filters with All, with Groups, and with Users. See the [Admin Console documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-products-and-profiles.html) for more information.|Can share filters only with individual users.|

When should you share filters with the entire company versus just a group of users or individuals? Here are some best practices you might follow:

* As an Admin, share a filter with All if it's of use to the entire company and everyone is comfortable using it. In this case, you should also consider making it an approved filter.

* As an Admin, share a filter with a specific Product Profile if the filter provides good business value for that team. Do not officially approve this type of filter.

* As an Admin or an individual user, share a filter with other individuals to vet and validate a filter. If it doesn't prove useful, it can be discarded. Do not officially approve this type of filter. 

To share a filter:

1. In the Filter Manager, mark the checkbox next to the filter you want to share. 

1. In the filter management tool bar, click **[!UICONTROL Share]**.

1. If you are an Admin, you can select All or choose from Groups and Users in your organization. As a non-Admin, you can see only individual users. Use the Search field to search for groups or users. Click **[!UICONTROL Share]**. The Shared icon appears next to the filter: ![](https://spectrum.adobe.com/static/icons/workflow_18/Smock_Share_18_N.svg)

1. You can filter on filters shared with you by going to Filters > Other Filters > Shared with Me.
