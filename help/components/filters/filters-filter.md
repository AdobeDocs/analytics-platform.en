# Filter the list of segments

You can filter the list of segments. Using a filter on segments makes it easier to find the segments that are available to you, and manage segments from the [Segment manager](manage-filters.md). 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The list of segments refers to the [segment list](manage-filters.md#filters-list) as part of the [Segment manager](manage-filters.md). You can filter that list using the ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) [Filter panel](manage-filters.md#filter-panel), part of that same [Segment manager](manage-filters.md).

To filter the list of segments:

1. Select ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) to open the Filters panel. If you need more space for the Filters list, you can select ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) once more to close the panel.
1. Select filters from any of the available [filter sections](#filter-sections).
