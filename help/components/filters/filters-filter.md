# Filter the list of filters

You can filter the list of filters. Using a filter on filters makes it easier to find the filters that are available to you, and manage filters from the [Filter manager](manage-filters.md). 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The list of filters does refer to the [filter list](manage-filters.md#filters-list) as part of the [Filter manager](manage-filters.md). You can filter that list using the ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) [Filter panel](manage-filters.md#filter-panel), part of that same [Filter manager](manage-filters.md).

To filter the list of filters:

1. Select ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) to open the Filters panel. If you need more space for the Filters list, you can select ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) once more to close the panel.
1. Select filters from any of the available [filter sections](#filter-sections).

   >*Items* refer to the filter items displayed in the [Filter list](manage-filters.md#filters-list).

## Filter sections

{{tagfiltersection}} 
{{dataviewfiltersection}}
{{ownerfiltersection}}
{{otherfiltersfiltersection}}


The [Filter list](manage-filters.md#filters-list) is automatically updated based on your filter configuration. You can see the configured filters in the [Active filter bar](manage-filters.md#active-filter-bar).
