# Copy filters

In the [Filter manager](manage-filters.md), you can copy filters. Copying a filter is convenient when you want to create a slightly modified version of an existing filter or want to redefine a filter you do not own and you cannot edit.

1. In the [Filter manager](manage-filters.md), select one or more of the filters you want to copy.
1. From the action bar, select ![Copy](/help/assets/icons/Copy.svg) **[!UICONTROL Copy]**.

The filters are copied and appear in the filter list with the same name as their original but with (Copy) appended to it.
