# Mark filters as favorites {#favorites}

Marking filters as favorites is another way to organize them for ease of use.

1. In the Filters manager, select the star next to any filter that you want to mark as a favorite. The star turns yellow when you select it.

1. (Optional) You can sort your list of filters by favorites. Select the Filter icon in the left rail, then select [!UICONTROL **Other filters**] > [!UICONTROL **Favorites**].
