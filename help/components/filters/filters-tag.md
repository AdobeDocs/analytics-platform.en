# Tag filters {#tag}

In the [Filter manager](manage-filters.md), you can use tags to organize filters. All users can create tags for filters and apply one or more tags to a filter. You can see tags only for those filters that you have created or that have been shared with you.

To tag one or more filters:

1. In the [Filter manager](manage-filters.md), select one or more of the filters you want to tag.
1. From the action bar, select ![Labels](/help/assets/icons/Labels.svg) **[!UICONTROL Tag]**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Tag Filters]** dialog
   
   ![Tag Filters dialog](assets/tag-filter-dialog.png)

   1. (optionally) use ![Search](/help/assets/icons/Search.svg) to search for and limit the list of tags.

   2. Based on the list of tags:
   
      * select one or more existing tags from the list, or
      * enter a new tag and press **[!UICONTROL ENTER]**. Repeat to add more than one new tag.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the tags for the filter. Select **[!UICONTROL Cancel]** to cancel.

Once saved, the tags are listed in the [!UICONTROL Tag] field for the selected filters in the [Filter builder](filter-builder.md).
