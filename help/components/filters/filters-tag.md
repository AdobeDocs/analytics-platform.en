# Tag filters

1. From the action bar, select ![Labels](/help/assets/icons/Labels.svg) **[!UICONTROL Tag]**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Tag Filters]** dialog:
   
   ![Tag Filters dialog](assets/tag-filter-dialog.png)

   1. (optionally) use ![Search](/help/assets/icons/Search.svg) to search for and limit the list of tags.

   2. Based on the list of tags:
   
      * select one or more existing tags from the list, or
      * enter a new tag and press **[!UICONTROL ENTER]**. Repeat to add more than one new tag.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the tags for the filter. Select **[!UICONTROL Cancel]** to cancel.

Once saved, the tags are listed in the [!UICONTROL Tag] field for the selected filters in the [Filter builder](filter-builder.md).
