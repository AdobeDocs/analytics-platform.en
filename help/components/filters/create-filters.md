# Create filters

You can create different types of filters in Customer Journey Analytics.  The type you select depends on how complex the filters need to be and whether the filters should apply to the current Workspace project only or apply to all projects. You can create filters directly in the main interface of Customer Journey Analytics or when working in a Workspace project. 

By default, only administrators can create filters. Users have rights to view filters, similar to how users view other components (such as annotations, calculated metrics, etc.).

However, administrators can give the **[!UICONTROL Filter Creation]** permission for **[!UICONTROL Reporting Tools]** in **[!UICONTROL Edit permissions for CJA Workspace Access]** to users via the [Admin Console](/help/technotes/access-control.md#user-level-access).

You can create a filter in the following ways:

![Ways to create a filter](assets/create-filter.png)

* 🅐 In the main interface, select **[!UICONTROL Components]** and select **[!UICONTROL Filters]**. Select ![AddCircle](/help/assets/icons/AddCircle.svg) [!UICONTROL **[!UICONTROL Add]**] from the [[!UICONTROL Filters] manager](/help/components/filters/manage-filters.md). 
* 🅑 In a Workspace project, from the Components left panel, select ![Add](/help/assets/icons/Add.svg) at ![Segment](/help/assets/icons/Segmentation.svg) **Filters**.
* 🅒 In a Workspace project, from the context menu in a visualization, select **[!UICONTROL Create filter from selection]**.
* 🅓 In a Workspace project, select **[!UICONTROL Components]** from the menu, and select **[!UICONTROL Create filter]**. 
* 🅔 In a Workspace project, use the shortcut **[!UICONTROL shift+cmd+e]** (macOS) or **[!UICONTROL shift+ctrl+e]** (Windows).
* 🅕 Select ![Add](/help/assets/icons/Add.svg) in ***Drop a filter here (or any other component)*** drop zone. This action creates a Project-only filter.

To define the new filter, you use the [Filter builder](/help/components/filters/filter-builder.md).

When you are in a Workspace project, you can also create a filter quickly using [Quick filter](/help/components/filters/quick-filters.md).
