# Use real-time reporting

{{release-limited-testing}}

To use real-time reporting, enable the **[!UICONTROL Real-time refresh]** toggle on any of the following panels in your Workspace project:



* [Blank panel](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/blank-panel.md)
* [Freeform](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/freeform-panel.md)
* [Attribution](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/attribution.md)
* [Next or previous item](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/next-previous.md)
* [Quick insights](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/quickinsight.md)

You see a message with the timestamp of the most recent refresh of the data. For example: [!UICONTROL  *Last refreshed at 07:55 pm*].

Select the real-time period you want to report on from the drop-down menu. Available options are:

* [!UICONTROL Last 15 minutes]
* [!UICONTROL Last 30 minutes]
* [!UICONTROL Last hour]
* [!UICONTROL Last 8 hours]
* [!UICONTROL Last 24 hours]

All visualizations in the panel are now updated every minute for a maximum of 30 minutes while the browser tab with the real-time refresh enabled panel is active.

After 30 minutes, or as soon as the browser tab becomes inactive, the **[!UICONTROL Real-time refesh]** toggle is disabled automatically and real-time updates are stopped.
