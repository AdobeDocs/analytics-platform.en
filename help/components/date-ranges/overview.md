# Date ranges overview

Date ranges are a type of component you can use in Workspace projects. They allow you to see data trended over time or see when events happen the most. Date ranges are color coded in purple.

Custom date ranges allow you to customize the dates you see in Workspace projects. Use the Date range manager to [manage](manage.md) or [create](create.md) custom date ranges.
