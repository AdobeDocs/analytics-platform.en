# Date ranges overview

In a Workspace project, you typically use the [calendar in a panel](/help/analysis-workspace/c-panels/panels.md#calendar) to specify the date range for the visualizations in that panel.

Date range components enable you to define and override the calendar settings for the panel.

## Use date ranges

You can use a date range component to redefine the calendar for the panel.

Or, you can use a date range in a Freeform table as a metric or dimension.

![Date range usage](/help/components/date-ranges/assets/date-ranges-usage.png)

- **Metric**. For example, to compare a dimension for two different months for a specific metric.
- **Dimension**. To compare a metric on different dimension items for the date range dimension.

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you use date ranges in a Freeform table, the date ranges override the calendar specified for the panel to which the Freeform table belongs.
>

You use a date range as you would [use any component](/help/components/overview.md#analysis-workspace-components). You drag the date range from the ![Calendar](/help/assets/icons/Calendar.svg) **[!UICONTROL Date ranges]** component panel and drop the component on:

- **[!UICONTROL Calendar]**: You ![Switch](/help/assets/icons/Switch.svg) **[!UICONTROL Replace]** the current calendar configuration with the date range.
- **Metric column header**: You ![Switch](/help/assets/icons/Switch.svg) **[!UICONTROL Replace]** the metric, ![Add](/help/assets/icons/Add.svg)**[!UICONTROL Add]** the date range as a metric, or ![Filter](/help/assets/icons/Filter.svg) **[!UICONTROL Filter]** the metric using the date range component.
- **Dimension column header**: You  ![Switch](/help/assets/icons/Switch.svg) **[!UICONTROL Replace]** the current dimensions. The new dimension is now **[!UICONTROL Date ranges]**. Once the dimension is Date ranges, you can ![Add](/help/assets/icons/Add.svg)**[!UICONTROL Add]** additional date ranges as dimension items.
- **Dimension item**: You ![Breakdown](/help/assets/icons/Breakdown.svg) **[!UICONTROL Breakdown]** the specific dimension item by the date range.

You can also add a date range column directly in a Freeform table visualization:

1. In a metric column, select from the context menu:

   - **[!UICONTROL Add time period column]**. You can select between suggested options that are based on the current calendar or create a [custom date range](#custom-date-ranges).
   - **[!UICONTROL Compare time periods]**. You can select between a suggested option that is based on the current calendar or create a [custom date range](#custom-date-ranges).

1. Based upon your selection, additional date range columns are added to the Freeform table.

## Custom date ranges

You can create your own custom date ranges. See [Create date range](/help/components/date-ranges/create.md) for the various options available to create date ranges. You then build, modify, and save date ranges in the [Date range builder](create.md#date-range-builder).

You use the [Date range manager](manage.md) to manage date ranges.
