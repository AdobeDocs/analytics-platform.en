# Create a date range

You can create a custom date range using either of the following two methods:

* Directly in a workspace project by clicking the '`+`' button next to the list of date range components on the left
* Within the date range manager

To create a date range in the date range manager:

1. Log in to [analytics.adobe.com](https://analytics.adobe.com) using your AdobeID credentials.
1. Navigate to [!UICONTROL Components] > [!UICONTROL Date Ranges].
1. Click the [!UICONTROL Add] button to open the modal window that creates a date range.

## Create a date range modal window

The modal window has four fields you can edit:

* **Date range**: The date range you want for this component.
* **Title**: The name you want for this component. The title is used in workspace projects.
* **Description**: The description you want for this component. The description is seen when clicking the ![i](../assets/i.png) icon.
* **Tags**: Use tags to organize your date ranges. A date range can belong to multiple tags.

## Selecting a date range

When clicking the date range in the modal window, you have several options:

* **Calendar**: Select the start and end date.
* **Use rolling dates**: Check this box if you want the date range to change as time goes on. Do not check this box if you want your date range to remain static.
* **Select preset**: Use this drop-down selection if you want a custom date range based on a range that Adobe offers by default. When you select a preset, you can further customize the date range to suit your needs. It does not affect the preset that Adobe offers.

## Rolling date ranges

If you want a rolling date range, you can customize when it rolls. You can control when the start and end dates roll independently of each other.

* **When the date starts**: Choose if the date starts at the beginning of a time period, at the end of a time period, or use a fixed day.
* **The time period to use**: Choose how often the date range rolls. You can have it roll every day, every week, every month, every quarter, or every year.
* **Offset**: Choose the offset of the date range. You can add or subtract days, weeks, months, quarters, or years.

## Rolling date examples

Some date ranges can be useful in certain reports.

Year-to-date:

```text
Start: Start of current year
End: End of current day
```

Last Thursday to this Thursday:

```text
Start: Start of current week minus 3 days
End: Start of current week plus 4 days
```

Fiscal year (for example, if a fiscal year starts in December)

```text
Start: Start of current year minus 1 month
End: End of current year minus 1 month
```
