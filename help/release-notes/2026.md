| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Analyze audiences from Experience Platform Profile datasets in Customer Journey Analytics** | You can now ingest audience membership data from Experience Platform Profile datasets into a Customer Journey Analytics connection. Audiences become available as new dimensions for use in Analysis Workspace.<p>This is made possible through a new capability in Customer Journey Analytics to ingest XDM object-maps, which makes it possible to ingest Profile AudienceIDs.</p><p>Previously, only simple XDM maps could be ingested into Customer Journey Analytics.</p><p>In addition to being able to add audience data as dimensions to any project in Analysis Workspace, the following new Workspace templates are also available:</p><ul><li>Audience Analytics Overview</li><li>Consent Policy Overview</li></ul><p>For more information, see [Audience analysis overview](/help/connections/audience-analysis/audience-analysis-overview.md).</p> | October 22, 2025 | January 22, 2026 |
| **Data storytelling: Generate slide presentations from Workspace reports** | You can now automatically generate a slide presentation (in .pptx format) that is based on an Analysis Workspace report. Workspace detects key insights in your report and converts them into stakeholder-ready slides.<p>This feature reduces the time and effort required to surface findings, build executive narratives, and communicate business impact.</p><p>For more information, see [Data storytelling: Generate slide presentations from Workspace reports](/help/analysis-workspace/curate-share/generate-slides.md).</p> | October 22, 2025 | January 28, 2026 |
| **Combine data sources from multiple IMS orgs** | You can use the Analytics Source Connector to combine multiple data sources from multiple IMS orgs. This allows organzations to have a combined view of their customer data, even when that customer data is spread across multiple IMS orgs. <p>**Note:** This configuration is available only by submitting a request to Adobe Customer Care.</p>  <p>(Documentation link to follow.)</p> |  | January 30, 2026 |
| **Stitching in connections** | The stitching process in Customer Journey Analytics is now more simple. Instead of duplicating a dataset and applying stitching on the duplicated dataset, stitching is now done on the ingestion of data into Customer Journey Analytics, which removes the requirement of duplicated datasets and schemas. <p>Furthermore, you [initiate stitching yourself through an updated Connections interface](/help/stitching/use-stitching-ui.md), instead of having to request stitching through Adobe Customer Care. | October 28, 2025 | January 30, 2026 |
