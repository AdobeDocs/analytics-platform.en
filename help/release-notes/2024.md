| **Journey canvas visualization** | Journey canvas is a visualization in Analysis workspace that allows you to analyze how people proceed through or fall out of a defined journey. Build analyses of user journeys by creating a flexible graph of nodes and arrows representing any combination of events, dimension items, and segments. Drag nodes on the canvas to rearrange the events and conditions of the journey. As you do, data updates accordingly.<p>Customers with access to Adobe Journey Optimizer can analyze existing Journey Optimizer journeys.<p>To learn more about Journey canvas, see [Journey canvas overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-workspace/visualizations/journey-canvas/journey-canvas).<p>To learn how to build a Journey canvas visualization, see [Configure Journey canvas](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-workspace/visualizations/journey-canvas/configure-journey-canvas). |  October 2, 2024 | October 14, 2024  |
| **Panel segments and column segments are now included when creating an audience** | When creating an audience from a visualization within Analysis Workspace, panel segments and column segments are now included as additional criteria.

| **Additional information in the "Used in" column in the calculated metric manager and segment manager** | The "Used in" column in the calculated metric manager and segment manager contains the following new reporting areas:<ul><li>**Report Builder**: Shows the number of calculated metrics or segments that are being used in the Report Builder.</li><li>**Ad hoc components**: Shows the number of ad hoc calculated metrics or ad hoc segments that are used in projects. These ad hoc calculated metrics and segments (otherwise known as "quick calculated metrics" and "quick segments") can be used only in the project where they were created, so they are reported separately from the "Project" reporting area in the "Used in" column.</li></ul>For more information, see [Calculated metrics manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-components/cja-calcmetrics/cm-workflow/cm-manager) and [Filters manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-components/cja-filters/manage-filters).|  | Sept 11, 2024 |
| **Alerts** | Alerts in Customer Journey Analytics allow you to be notified based on changed percentages or specific data points.<p>Depending on your Customer Journey Analytics package, you can also use alerts to be triggered based on anomaly thresholds. These alerts (also known as "Intelligent Alerts"), provide granular controls that integrate with Anomaly Detection, triggering when you need them most.</p><p>The process of using alerts in Customer Journey Analytics is nearly identical to using alerts in Adobe Analytics. One key difference is that hourly alerts are not available in Customer Journey Analytics. This difference is because data ingestion for the various kinds of event data that can be ingested is complete only after a delay, typically ranging from 3 to 9 hours past the data event time.</p><p>For more information about the differences when using alerts in Customer Journey Analytics from Adobe Analytics, see [Alerts feature comparison](/help/components/c-intelligent-alerts/alerts-feature-comparison.md).</p><p>To learn more about alerts, see [Alerts overview](/help/components/c-intelligent-alerts/intelligent-alerts.md)|  | September 13, 2024 |
| **Updates to the Adobe Analytics source connector** | The dataset activity page does not display information about batches since the Analytics Source Connector is entirely managed by Adobe. You can monitor that data is flowing by looking at the metrics around ingested records. Read the guide on [creating a source connection for Analytics data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/sources/ui-tutorials/create/adobe-applications/analytics) for more information. |  | Available now |
| **Guided analysis: Embed in Workspace** |  Combine multiple guided analyses into a single view in Analysis Workspace. (Documentation link to follow) | October 2, 2024  | October 31, 2024 |
