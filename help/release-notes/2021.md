| Rolling window for [!UICONTROL Connection] data retention | **Note: Please contact Customer Care or your Adobe Account Team to have this setting implemented. It is not yet available via the Customer Journey Analytics UI.**<p>Lets you define a Customer Journey Analytics data retention setting as a rolling window in months (3 months, 6 months, etc.), at a [!UICONTROL connection] level (not at a [!UICONTROL dataset] level). Data retention is based on event dataset timestamps and applies to event datasets only. No data retention setting exists for profile or lookup datasets since there are no applicable timestamps. The main benefit is that you store or report only on data that is applicable and useful and delete older data that is no longer useful. It helps you stay under your contract limits and reduces the risk of overage cost. | October 7, 2021 |
| Report Builder support | Report Builder is a Microsoft&reg; [!DNL Excel] Add-in that allows you to easily create, edit, and refresh custom reports using Customer Journey Analytics data.

With Report Builder for Customer Journey Analytics, you can:<ul><li>Reference existing worksheet cells to get the perfect row order, date range, or filter</li><li>Create custom dates using calendar, cell references, or date math</li><li>Design your tables and visualizations with familiar Excel formatting tools</li><li>Available for Excel on macOS, Microsoft 365 for the web, and Microsoft Windows</li></ul>[Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-reportbuilder/report-buider-overview.html#) | October 7, 2021 |
