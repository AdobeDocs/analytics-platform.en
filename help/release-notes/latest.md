**Last update**: May 22, 2025


These release notes cover the release period of April 22 to June 18, 2025. Adobe Customer Journey Analytics releases operate on a [continuous delivery model](releases.md), which allows for a more scalable, phased approach to feature deployment. Accordingly, these release notes get updated several times a month. Please check them regularly.
