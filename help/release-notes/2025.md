## October 2025 {#oct25}

| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Filter criteria included in line visualizations and sparklines** |Any search filter criteria that you apply to a freeform table filter is now always included in sparklines. In addition, you can include search filter criteria in any connected line visualization.<p>You can configure line visualizations to include search filter criteria by selecting the sparkline in the metric column header of the connected table.</p><p>Previously, search filter criteria was not included in sparklines or connected line visualizations.</p><p>For more information, see [View trended data for a freeform table](/help/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/freeform-table-trended-data.md).</p> | | October 15, 2025|
| **Data storytelling: Generate slide presentations from Workspace reports** | You can now automatically generate a slide presentation (in .pptx format) that is based on an Analysis Workspace report. Workspace detects key insights in your report and converts them into stakeholder-ready slides.<p>This feature reduces the time and effort required to surface findings, build executive narratives, and communicate business impact.</p><p>For more information, see [Data storytelling: Generate slide presentations from Workspace reports](/help/analysis-workspace/curate-share/generate-slides.md).</p> | October 22, 2025 | January 2026 |
| **Real-time reporting** | [Real-time reporting in Customer Journey Analytics](/help/components/real-time/real-time.md) displays and updates data and visualizations within one or more panels in Analysis Workspace in real time. | September 18,  2025 (Originally planned to release on August 15, 2025) | October 22, 2025 |
| **Support for data mirror**  | With support for model-based schemas and change data capture (CDC) functionality for specific source connectors in Experience Platform, Customer Journey Analytics will be able to support [data mirror](/help/data-mirror/data-mirror.md) functionality of data warehouse solutions like [!DNL Snowflake], [!DNL Azure Databricks], and [!DNL Google BigQuery].<p>Contact your Adobe Account Team to access the beta.</p> | Beta release: September 24, 2025 | TBD |
| **Stitching in connections** | Simplifies Customer Journey Analytics stitching. Instead of duplicating a dataset and applying stitching on the duplicated dataset, stitching is now done on the ingestion of data into Customer Journey Analytics, which removes the requirement of duplicated datasets and schemas. <p>Furthermore, instead of having to request stitching through customer support, you can now [initiate stitching yourself from an updated Connections UI](/help/stitching/use-stitching-ui.md).</p><p> *The previously communicated releases dates are pushed due to additional efforts required. The new release dates overlap with the holiday season, which introduces additional release constraints. A phased rollout is now planned to ensure stability and minimize disruption during the holiday period.*</p> | October 28, 2025 | January 30, 2026 |
| **Streaming media services: Support schedule data** | You can now upload scheduled data of past live Streaming Media content to more easily and accurately track viewership.<p>The following are examples of live content that are supported with schedule data upload:</p><ul><li>FAST (Free Ad Supported TV) platforms</li><li>Local streams</li><li>Live sports</li></ul><p>Uploading schedule data allows you to track viewership data for individual programs that ran during the time you designate in the upload file. You can even gather viewership data for specific topics or program segments.</p><p>These capabilities are available regardless of how you implemented Streaming Media Collection.</p><p>Previously, it was difficult to accurately tie a given session to specific programs when analyzing live content, and it wasn't possible to tie a given session to individual topics or program segments.</p><p>For more information, see [Upload schedule data to track live content](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/media-use-cases/track-schedule-data)</p>| October 29, 2025 | First half of 2026<p>(Originally planned to release on October 29, 2025)</p> |
| **Analytics source connector: Search report suites in Experience Platform** | If you do have a high number of report suites you can now [search for the report suite](/help/data-ingestion/analytics.md#set-up-an-adobe-analytics-source-connector) you want to connect to within the Analytics Source Connector dataflow workflow. | | October 30, 2025 |
| **Streaming Media: Updated XDM fields for collecting Streaming Media data into Adobe Experience Platform** | When collecting Streaming Media data into Adobe Experience Platform, the XDM field paths shown under the heading of "XDM Field Path" of the Streaming Media parameters documentation should no longer be used. Instead, customers who implemented the Analytics source connector to collect Streaming Media data into Platform before May 9, 2025 must migrate their existing configurations to the mediaReporting field paths, as shown under the heading of "Reporting XDM Field Path" of the Streaming Media parameters documentation.<p> These field paths are found on the following pages and are marked as "Deprecated": [Audio and video parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/audio-video-parameters), [Ad parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/ad-parameters), [Chapter parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/chapter-parameters), [Player state parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/player-state-parameters), and [Quality parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/quality-parameters). (No action is required for customers who implement the Analytics source connector after May 9, 2025, and are already using only mediaReporting XDM paths.)</p><p>Data ingestion on the deprecated XDM field paths will continue until the end of October 2025. After that time, deprecated field paths will be fully removed and no longer visible in the Adobe Experience Platform Schema UI, and data will be sent only using the mediaReporting field paths.</p><p>For more information, see [Migrate an Analytics Source Connector implementation to updated XDM Streaming Media fields](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/media-use-cases/xdm-updates/updated-xdm-fields).</p><p>Please contact your Adobe Consulting Services or Account team for migration support. </p> |  | October 2025 |

| **Increase in full table export limits** | We are increasing the number of columns customers can use with full table export from 5 dimensions and 5 metrics to 10 dimensions and 10 metrics. This applies to all Customer Journey Analytics tiers. There is no change in the entitlements for the number of rows which can be exported. |  |  April 30, 2025 |
| **Updates to "No Value" line item on numeric dimensions** | For numeric dimensions, this update lets you<ul><li>Use the "No Value" dimension item in a segment.</li><li>Perform a breakdown in a report on the "No Value" line item.</li></ul> [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/no-value-options#numeric) | | March 27, 2025 |
| **Adobe Content Analytics** |  Adobe Content Analytics allows you to quickly and easily investigate large volumes of content data to uncover trends, spot anomalies, identify content fatigue, and gain insights from content exposure.<p>Out of the box, you can save time with pre-built reporting templates and new features like Asset Inspector. This capability lets you not only visualize the asset in-line with your data, but also open each asset for summarized details including performance, placements, attributes and more.<p>You can investigate this new set of content data within the context of the complete customer journey to answer important business questions, assess content performance, enhance segmentation, identify optimization opportunities, and define new audiences for activation.<p>Content Analytics is an add-on to Customer Journey Analytics.

| **Media Collection: Adobe Source Connector updates for new Media Reporting XDM** | The Analytics Source Connector automatically maps streaming media data in Adobe Analytics to the same fields used by the Web SDK. Previously, data was mapped to both the old and new locations, but only the new location will be used in the future. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/implementation/aep-edge/xdm-var-mapping) |  | March 31, 2025 |
| **Updated XDM fields for collecting Streaming Media data into Adobe Experience Platform** | When collecting Streaming Media data into Adobe Experience Platform, the XDM field paths shown under the heading of "XDM Field Path" of the Streaming Media parameters documentation should no longer be used. These field paths are found on the following pages and are marked as "Deprecated": [Audio and video parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/audio-video-parameters), [Ad parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/ad-parameters), [Chapter parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/chapter-parameters), [Player state parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/player-state-parameters), and [Quality parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/quality-parameters). <p>Instead, customers should migrate to the `mediaReporting` field paths, as shown under the heading of "Reporting XDM Field Path" of the Streaming Media parameters documentation referenced above.<p>During a transitional period of three months, data ingestion on the deprecated XDM field paths will continue. However, at the end of July 2025, deprecated field paths will be fully removed and no longer visible in the Adobe Experience Platform Schema UI, and data will be sent only using the `mediaReporting` field paths.<p>Customers who implemented the Analytics source connector to collect Streaming Media data into Platform before April 22, 2025 must migrate their existing configurations to use the new field paths. This migration must be complete by the end of July 2025. Please contact your Adobe Consulting Services or Account team for migration support. No action is required for customers who implement the Analytics source connector after April 22, 2025.</p> |  | April 22, 2025  |
| **Terminology change: "Filters" to "Segments"** | Previously, Adobe Customer Journey Analytics referred to segments as "filters". This terminology has now been brought in line with Adobe Analytics. "Filters" are now called "segments". (Obviously, search filters are still called "filters".) The UI and documentation have been updated. | |April 16, 2025 |
| **Stitching: Retrieve persistent and transient IDs from XDM IdentityMap** |  This feature provides support for using identities stored in the XDM identityMap in the stitching process. The identityMap can be used for the persistent or transient ID for field-based stitching and can be used for the persistent ID for graph-based stitching.  You can use either a specific namespace or primary identity from the identityMap. Learn more [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/stitching/fbs#identitymap) and [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/stitching/gbs#identitymap)|  | April 28, 2025 |
| **Shared metrics and dimensions across data views** | Allows you to apply dimension and metric settings across multiple data views. Changes made to a shared dimension or metric apply to all instances of that dimension or metric across all applicable data views. This interface allows Customer Journey Analytics admins to more easily manage components when many data views are used.
