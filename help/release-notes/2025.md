| Feature | Description | [Rollout starts](releases.md) | [General Availability](releases.md) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| **Increase in full table export limits** | We are increasing the number of columns customers can use with full table export from 5 dimensions and 5 metrics to 10 dimensions and 10 metrics. This applies to all Customer Journey Analytics tiers. There is no change in the entitlements for the number of rows which can be exported. |  |  April 30, 2025 |
| **Updates to "No Value" line item on numeric dimensions** | For numeric dimensions, this update lets you<ul><li>Use the "No Value" dimension item in a segment.</li><li>Perform a breakdown in a report on the "No Value" line item.</li></ul> [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/no-value-options#numeric) | | March 27, 2025 |
| **Adobe Content Analytics** |  Adobe Content Analytics allows you to quickly and easily investigate large volumes of content data to uncover trends, spot anomalies, identify content fatigue, and gain insights from content exposure.<p>Out of the box, you can save time with pre-built reporting templates and new features like Asset Inspector. This capability lets you not only visualize the asset in-line with your data, but also open each asset for summarized details including performance, placements, attributes and more.<p>You can investigate this new set of content data within the context of the complete customer journey to answer important business questions, assess content performance, enhance segmentation, identify optimization opportunities, and define new audiences for activation.<p>Content Analytics is an add-on to Customer Journey Analytics. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/content-analytics/content-analytics) |  | March 27, 2025 |
| **Media Collection: Adobe Source Connector updates for new Media Reporting XDM** | The Analytics Source Connector automatically maps streaming media data in Adobe Analytics to the same fields used by the Web SDK. Previously, data was mapped to both the old and new locations, but only the new location will be used in the future. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/implementation/aep-edge/xdm-var-mapping) |  | March 31, 2025 |
| **Updated XDM fields for collecting Streaming Media data into Adobe Experience Platform** | When collecting Streaming Media data into Adobe Experience Platform, the XDM field paths shown under the heading of "XDM Field Path" of the Streaming Media parameters documentation should no longer be used. These field paths are found on the following pages and are marked as "Deprecated": [Audio and video parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/audio-video-parameters), [Ad parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/ad-parameters), [Chapter parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/chapter-parameters), [Player state parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/player-state-parameters), and [Quality parameters](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/quality-parameters). <p>Instead, customers should migrate to the `mediaReporting` field paths, as shown under the heading of "Reporting XDM Field Path" of the Streaming Media parameters documentation referenced above.<p>During a transitional period of three months, data ingestion on the deprecated XDM field paths will continue. However, at the end of July 2025, deprecated field paths will be fully removed and no longer visible in the Adobe Experience Platform Schema UI, and data will be sent only using the `mediaReporting` field paths.<p>Customers who implemented the Analytics source connector to collect Streaming Media data into Platform before April 22, 2025 must migrate their existing configurations to use the new field paths. This migration must be complete by the end of July 2025. Please contact your Adobe Consulting Services or Account team for migration support. No action is required for customers who implement the Analytics source connector after April 22, 2025.</p> |  | April 22, 2025  |
| **Terminology change: "Filters" to "Segments"** | Previously, Adobe Customer Journey Analytics referred to segments as "filters". This terminology has now been brought in line with Adobe Analytics. "Filters" are now called "segments". (Obviously, search filters are still called "filters".) The UI and documentation have been updated. | |April 16, 2025 |
| **Stitching: Retrieve persistent and transient IDs from XDM IdentityMap** |  This feature provides support for using identities stored in the XDM identityMap in the stitching process. The identityMap can be used for the persistent or transient ID for field-based stitching and can be used for the persistent ID for graph-based stitching.  You can use either a specific namespace or primary identity from the identityMap. Learn more [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/stitching/fbs#identitymap) and [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/stitching/gbs#identitymap)|  | April 28, 2025 |
| **Shared metrics and dimensions across data views** | Allows you to apply dimension and metric settings across multiple data views. Changes made to a shared dimension or metric apply to all instances of that dimension or metric across all applicable data views. This interface allows Customer Journey Analytics admins to more easily manage components when many data views are used.
