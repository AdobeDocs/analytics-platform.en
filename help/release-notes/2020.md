# 2020 Customer Journey Analytics release notes

## November 2020 {#1120}

| Feature | [General Availability](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/landing/an-releases.html) - Target Date | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Customer Journey Analytics documentation | November 11, 2020 | Customer Journey Analytics documentation has moved to Experience League. During November, all articles, videos, release notes, and tutorials moved from their current location at `experienceleague.adobe.com` to `experienceleague.adobe.com`. This move ensures that all learning, self-help, enablement, and community content is served from a single location. All links were redirected to Experience League. |
| [!UICONTROL Line] visualization: Moving average trendline option | October 8, 2020 | Moving average has been added to Line visualization trendline settings. A moving average calculates the mean for a specified prior period and uses that as the trendline data point, then moves to the next period.

| Removing backfill limitation | October 19, 2020 | In order to provide an improved Customer Journey Analytics experience, we have removed the backfill (historical data import) limitation. Previously, you could backfill a maximum of 2.5 billion rows on your own and otherwise required engineering involvement. Now, you can backfill data on your own, without any limitation. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-connections/create-connection.html#enable-connection) |
| Analysis Workspace Performance Help page | October 22, 2020 | The Analysis Workspace performance help page shows the different factors that impact project performance and links to tips for optimization. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/workspace-faq/optimizing-performance.html) |
| [!UICONTROL Time Spent] metrics and dimensions | October 30, 2020 | [!UICONTROL Time Spent] metrics and dimensions allow you to see the amount of time that consumers spend in various aspects of the customer journey, giving you a more complete view into engagement and bottlenecks across channels. |
| [!UICONTROL Device] and [!UICONTROL Geography] dimensions | October 30, 2020 | [!UICONTROL Device] and [!UICONTROL Geography] dimensions are now available by default as part of the "Global Lookup support" project in the [Adobe Analytics Source connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/tutorials/data-ingestion/ingest-data-from-adobe-analytics.html). This much-requested addition increases [parity between Adobe Analytics and Customer Journey Analytics](/help/getting-started/aa-vs-cja/cja-aa.md). |
| Journey IQ: Cross-channel Analytics | January 11, 2021 |  Journey IQ: Cross-channel Analytics enables customers to re-key an Adobe Analytics (or other) event dataset in Adobe Experience Platform data lake from one ID namespace to another. Typically, this means re-keying the event dataset from a cookie-based ID to a person-based ID. This way, the re-keyed dataset may be combined with other person-based data in a Customer Journey Analytics connection, thus enabling cross-device/cross-channel analysis in Analysis Workspace.

Previously, static rows could be sorted only by a metric column or alphabetically.</li></ul>Associated documentation will be published when this feature releases later in January.|
