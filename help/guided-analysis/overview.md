# Guided analysis overview

Guided analysis enables users, from marketing to product to analysts, to self-serve high quality data and insights about the customer journey through guided workflows, built on the cross-channel data of Customer Journey Analytics. Similar to Analysis Workspace and Mobile scorecards, Guided analysis uses data from a [Data view](/help/data-views/data-views.md), which references data in Adobe Experience Platform through a [Connection](../connections/overview.md). Many reports created in Guided analysis can seamlessly transfer to Analysis Workspace for additional research.

The following guided analyses are available:

## Interface

The interface for Guided analysis follows a question and answer format. Form your question in the query rail, then get an answer with a written insight, chart, and table. You can then ask the next question with analyses and visualization settings.

Guided analysis uses the following UI elements:

| Interface preview | UI Element | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Query rail](assets/query-rail.png){style="border:1px solid gray"} | **[!UICONTROL Query rail]** | Configure your *question* by selecting the desired components (events, properties, and segments) that make up an analysis.
