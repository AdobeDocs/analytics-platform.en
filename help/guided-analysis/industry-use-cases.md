# Industry use cases

Use cases for guided analysis vary by industry. This page provides some illustrative examples of what product teams can accomplish with guided analysis and Adobe Product Analytics capabilities. 

+++**Retail**

| Use case | Example | Impact | Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Optimize mobile shopping app** | Many customers downloaded an organization's mobile app but never came back. The company finds that customers use it just for the initial offer. They re-engaged those dormant customers. | **Increase LTV of mobile users.** Measure and increase app usage to develop a more 'happy path' user experience. | [Active user growth view](types/active.md)<br>[Net growth view](types/net-growth.md) |
| **Quantify impact of new checkout features** | A grocery store tests their way into online shopping. They quickly measure the impact of new checkout features such as product recommendations or curbside pickup. | **Increase conversion rates.** Measure business impact instead of just feature usage. | [Release impact view](types/release.md)<br>[First use view](types/first-use.md) |
| **Reduce membership churn** | An organization uncovers friction points in the customer journeys that cause customers to churn. It allows them to review membership programs and analyze behaviors of at-risk members. | **Reduce churn.** Identify ways to foster and nurture client relationships to prevent attrition and reduce churn. | [Active user growth view](types/active.md)<br>[Friction view](types/friction.md) |
| **Find inefficient sales journeys** | An organization uncovers inefficiencies in the journey of in-store sales associates where they are pulled away from customers. They adjust their process, which gives customers a more enjoyable in-store shopping experience. | **Improve sales response.** Reduce inefficient processes, which result in improved internal journeys and a positive customer experience. | [Friction view](types/friction.md) |

+++**Financial Services**

| Use case | Example | Impact | Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Quantify impact of new features** | A financial institution rolls out bank transfers with Zelle, and wants to understand the impact of the new feature on finishing transfers. Guided analysis allows them to see how customers react so that the marketing team can roll it out. | **Increase conversion rates.** Measure impact of new features on transfer conversions. | [Release impact view](types/release.md)<br>[First use view](types/first-use.md) |
| **Deflect call center calls** | Guided analysis reveals that an organization's five-step mobile claim process drives calls into their call center. They create an audience and send an email to those customers to better understand their experience. | **Isolate friction in the experience.** Improve "happy path" journeys and reduce calls. | [Friction view](types/friction.md)<br>[Conversion trends view](types/conversion-trends.md) |
| **Reduce customer churn** | An organization learns that customers that log into the banking mobile app with monthly frequency remain customers longer. Guided analysis allows them to identify who is at risk to churn and create a win-back strategy. | **Reduce churn.** Maintain level of customers while spending to acquire actual new customers. | [Active user growth view](types/active.md)<br>[Net growth view](types/net-growth.md) |
| **Recommend new features** | An organization notices that digital withdrawals have decreased in recent months. The number of calls to a financial advisor have increased. Guided analysis helps the organization to prioritize digital process optimizations with a steering committee. | **Create a data-driven roadmap.** Use data to plan and implement optimizations. | [Usage trends view](types/usage.md) |

+++**Travel and Hospitality**

| Use case | Example | Impact | Analysis |

| **Find friction in mobile check-in flow** | Seeing where people are successful or dropping out of the expected mobile check-in process allows an organization to easily identify areas for experience optimization. | **Increase CSAT and reduce IROPs.** Removing friction leads to a more seamless "day of travel" experience. | [Friction view](types/friction.md)<br>[Conversion trends view](types/conversion-trends.md) |
| **Deflect call center calls** | Seeing user experience in a funnel view shows a user where visitors hit friction, which leads to costly call center volume. The next steps to focus on are clear. | **Reduce call-center usage.** Get more 'happy path' user experiences and reduce costly calls. | [Friction view](types/friction.md)<br>[Conversion trends view](types/conversion-trends.md) |

Insights gained from Guided analysis help make marketing more effective. | **Personalize Medicare enrollment choices.** Compare common sequential actions by my most active plan members. | [Friction view](types/friction.md)<br>[Active user growth view](types/active.md) |

+++**High Tech and B2B**

| Use case | Example | Impact | Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Quantify impact of new features** | An organization can analyze uptick in usage on a new product feature and determine what segments work best. This analysis helps them prioritize where to spend resources to maximize user engagement and strengthen its partnership with marketing. | **Data-driven prioritization.** Make informed decisions about allocating resources. | [Release impact view](types/release.md)<br>[First use view](types/first-use.md) |
| **Identify roles that are under-utilizing the product** | An organization designs a product for use by engineers, product managers, and marketing. Guided analysis showed that while product managers and marketers use it nearly daily, the engineering staff largely did not adopt it. | **Grow product adoption.** Quickly identify user behavior in various ways. | [Active user growth view](types/active.md)<br>[Net growth view](types/net-growth.md) |
| **Remove friction points in the conversion process** | Requiring a purchase order number in the purchase flow prevents users who prefer credit cards from completing their orders. Conversions increased when that field was made optional. | **Improve customer experience.** Reduce potential churn. | [Friction view](types/friction.md)<br>[Conversion trends view](types/conversion-trends.md) |
| **Unlock self-serve analysis** | Getting access to insights is a challenge, and some users within an organization are not trained for analysis.
