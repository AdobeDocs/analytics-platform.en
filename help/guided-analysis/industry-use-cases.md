# Industry use cases

Use cases for guided analysis vary by industry. This page provides some illustrative examples of what product teams can accomplish with guided analysis and Adobe Product Analytics capabilities. 

+++**Retail**

| Use case | Example | Impact | Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Optimize mobile shopping app** | Many customers downloaded an organization's mobile app but never came back. The company finds that customers use it just for the initial offer. They re-engaged those dormant customers. | **Increase LTV of mobile users.** Measure and increase app usage to develop a more 'happy path' user experience. | [Active user growth view](types/active.md)<br>[Net growth view](types/net-growth.md) |
| **Quantify impact of new checkout features** | A grocery store tests their way into online shopping. They quickly measure the impact of new checkout features such as product recommendations or curbside pickup. | **Increase conversion rates.** Measure business impact instead of just feature usage. | [Release impact view](types/release.md)<br>[First use view](types/first-use.md) |
| **Reduce membership churn** | An organization uncovers friction points in the customer journeys that cause customers to churn. It allows them to review membership programs and analyze behaviors of at-risk members. | **Reduce churn.** Identify ways to foster and nurture client relationships to prevent attrition and reduce churn. | [Active user growth view](types/active.md)<br>[Friction view](types/friction.md) |
| **Find inefficient sales journeys** | An organization uncovers inefficiencies in the journey of in-store sales associates where they are pulled away from customers. They adjust their process, which gives customers a more enjoyable in-store shopping experience. | **Improve sales response.** Reduce inefficient processes, which result in improved internal journeys and a positive customer experience. | [Friction view](types/friction.md) |

+++**Financial Services**

| Use case | Example | Impact | Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

They create an audience and send an email to those customers to better understand their experience. | **Isolate friction in the experience.** Improve "happy path" journeys and reduce calls. | [Friction view](types/friction.md)<br>[Conversion trends view](types/conversion-trends.md) |
| **Reduce customer churn** | An organization learns that customers that log into the banking mobile app with monthly frequency remain customers longer. Guided analysis allows them to identify who is at risk to churn and create a win-back strategy. | **Reduce churn.** Maintain level of customers while spending to acquire actual new customers. | [Active user growth view](types/active.md)<br>[Net growth view](types/net-growth.md) |

| **Deflect call center calls** | Seeing user experience in a funnel view shows a user where visitors hit friction, which leads to costly call center volume. The next steps to focus on are clear. | **Reduce call-center usage.** Get more 'happy path' user experiences and reduce costly calls. | [Friction view](types/friction.md)<br>[Conversion trends view](types/conversion-trends.md) |

+++**High Tech and B2B**

| Use case | Example | Impact | Analysis |
