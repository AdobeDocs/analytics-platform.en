# Customer Journey Analytics hosting locations

Adobe Customer Journey Analytics is hosted in enterprise-class data centers from public-cloud service providers in North America, Europe, and APAC. 

Upon provisioning, customers designate the region in which their Adobe Experience Platform data will reside. The data ingested into CJA from the Adobe Experience Platform data lake will be stored in the same region.

See [Regional data collection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/core-services/interface/data-collection/rdc) in the Adobe Experience Cloud documentation for more information.
